*Ankan Aich,Yangming Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Depth Anything V2架构的单目深度估计方法，通过动态向量低秩适应技术将合成数据先验高效迁移到医疗领域，在手术内窥镜环境中显著提升深度估计精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督深度估计方法在内窥镜手术环境中表现脆弱，特别是在反光、充满液体的环境下，现有方法在薄手术工具和透明表面容易出现边界崩溃问题

Method: 利用Depth Anything V2架构的高保真合成先验，通过动态向量低秩适应技术进行高效领域适应，同时引入物理分层评估协议在SCARED数据集上进行严格评估

Result: 在SCARED数据集上达到98.1%的准确率（<1.25阈值），相比基线方法将平方相对误差降低了17%以上，在恶劣手术光照条件下表现出优越的鲁棒性

Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

TL;DR: 提出基于视频分析的自动评估系统，用于城市作战训练中的"进入并清理房间"演练，通过计算机视觉提取骨骼、视线和轨迹数据，开发特定任务指标评估心理运动流畅性、态势感知和团队协作。

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

### [3] [Lifelong Domain Adaptive 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23860)
*Qucheng Peng,Hongfei Xue,Pu Wang,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了终身领域自适应3D人体姿态估计的新任务，通过创新的GAN框架解决非平稳目标数据集和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法依赖受控环境标注数据，难以泛化到多样化的真实场景。传统领域自适应方法忽略了目标姿态数据集的非平稳性，需要解决持续适应新领域同时保留历史知识的问题。

Method: 提出创新的GAN框架，包含3D姿态生成器、2D姿态判别器和3D姿态估计器。构建了集成姿态感知、时间感知和领域感知知识的新型3D姿态生成器范式，以增强当前领域适应并缓解对先前领域的灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 首次将终身领域自适应引入3D人体姿态估计任务，提出的框架有效解决了领域偏移和灾难性遗忘问题，为3D HPE在真实场景中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的儿科MRI转合成CT框架，实现颅骨分割和颅缝分割，填补MRI无法显示骨骼和颅缝的空白


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT有辐射风险不适合儿童常规使用，MRI无辐射但无法显示颅骨和颅缝，需要一种非侵入性的方法来评估儿科颅骨发育和颅缝骨化

Method: 使用深度学习方法将T1加权MRI转换为合成CT，通过域特定的变分自编码器预测颅骨分割、生成颅缝概率热图并从中提取直接颅缝分割

Conclusion: 这是首个能从MRI生成合成CT并实现颅缝分割的儿科框架，填补了非侵入性颅骨评估的关键空白，为诊断和治疗颅骨发育相关疾病提供了新工具

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MGML框架解决多模态MRI数据不完整时的脑肿瘤分割问题，通过元参数化自适应模态融合和一致性正则化模块提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中多模态MRI数据常常不完整，难以充分利用可用信息，因此最大化利用不完整多模态信息成为关键研究挑战。

Method: 提出元引导多模态学习框架，包含元参数化自适应模态融合和一致性正则化模块。Meta-AMF根据可用模态生成自适应软标签监督信号，促进更一致的多模态融合；一致性正则化模块增强分割性能并提升框架鲁棒性。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上实验，相比多种先进方法取得更好性能。在BraTS2020上，15种缺失模态组合的平均Dice分数：全肿瘤87.55，肿瘤核心79.36，增强肿瘤62.67。

Conclusion: MGML框架能有效处理不完整多模态MRI数据，不改变原始模型架构，可方便集成到训练流程中进行端到端优化，在脑肿瘤分割任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

TL;DR: 提出基于AI的微血管吻合手术自动动作分割与性能评估框架，实现92.4%的动作分割准确率和85.5%的技能分类准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经外科微血管吻合手术需要精细操作技能，传统评估依赖专家主观评分，存在评分者间差异大、耗时等问题，需要自动化、可扩展的客观评估方案

Method: 提出三模块AI框架：1)基于YOLO和DeepSORT的器械尖端跟踪定位；2)基于自相似矩阵的动作边界检测和无监督聚类的动作分割；3)用于评估手术手势熟练度的监督分类模块

Conclusion: 该方法能为微外科教育提供客观实时反馈，实现标准化、数据驱动的培训协议，推进高风险手术环境中的能力评估

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

TL;DR: T2VAttack：针对文本到视频扩散模型的对抗攻击研究，从语义和时间两个维度评估模型脆弱性，发现微小提示词修改即可导致视频质量显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到视频扩散模型在生成高质量视频方面取得了显著进展，但其对抗攻击的脆弱性尚未得到充分研究。考虑到视频数据的动态特性，需要从语义和时间两个维度全面评估模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出T2VAttack框架，包含两种攻击目标（语义对齐和时间动态）和两种攻击方法：T2VAttack-S通过贪婪搜索识别关键词并用同义词替换；T2VAttack-I通过迭代插入优化词实现最小扰动。

Result: 在多个最先进的T2V模型（ModelScope、CogVideoX、Open-Sora、HunyuanVideo）上进行评估，发现即使单个词的替换或插入也能导致语义保真度和时间动态的显著退化。

Conclusion: 当前T2V扩散模型存在严重的安全漏洞，微小提示词修改即可破坏视频质量，凸显了提升模型对抗鲁棒性的紧迫需求。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Conclusion: 该方法仅需图像和相机位姿，通过4D高斯与扩散模型的协同优化，实现了高质量的自动驾驶场景视点外推，降低了传感器和标注依赖。

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

*Bertrand Rouet-Leduc,Claudia Hulbert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的时间序列卫星图像异常检测方法，通过预测无变化情况下的地表状态来识别地表变化，相比传统方法具有更高的敏感性和特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像地表变化检测对于灾害响应和环境监测至关重要，但由于大气噪声、季节变化和传感器伪影等因素的复杂相互作用，传统方法面临挑战。

Method: 使用基于SATLAS基础模型的修复模型，利用全球分布的训练数据训练模型从先前采集的时间序列中重建Sentinel-2图像的最后一帧，通过预测与观测的差异来检测异常。

Result: 在2023年土耳其-叙利亚地震序列中验证了该方法，成功检测到Tepehan的断裂特征，检测阈值比传统方法（时间中位数或Reed-Xiaoli异常检测器）低约三倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用免费多光谱卫星数据实现自动化、全球尺度的地表变化监测提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

### [10] [GCA-ResUNet: Medical Image Segmentation Using Grouped Coordinate Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23990)
*Jun Ding,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GCA-ResUNet，一种结合分组坐标注意力模块的医学图像分割框架，在保持CNN效率的同时增强全局表示能力，在Synapse和ACDC数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有U-Net类CNN模型在处理长距离上下文依赖（特别是多器官场景和低对比度区域）方面存在局限，而Transformer模型虽然能缓解这一问题，但需要更高计算资源和训练数据，不利于在资源受限的临床环境中部署。

Method: 提出轻量级即插即用的分组坐标注意力（GCA）模块，将通道上下文建模解耦为多个组以显式处理通道间的语义异质性，并集成方向感知坐标编码来捕获水平和垂直轴上的结构化空间依赖关系。

Result: 在Synapse和ACDC两个基准测试中，GCA-ResUNet分别达到86.11%和92.64%的Dice分数，优于包括Swin-UNet和TransUNet在内的一系列代表性CNN和Transformer方法，特别是在描绘具有复杂边界的小解剖结构方面表现一致改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在分割精度和计算效率之间提供了有利的权衡，为临床部署提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: GASeg是一个通过拓扑信息桥接几何与外观的自监督语义分割框架，使用可微分盒计数模块和多目标损失来提升对视觉模糊的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督语义分割方法在面对外观模糊（如阴影、眩光、局部纹理）时经常失败，因为过度依赖不稳定的外观特征。需要利用更稳定的拓扑信息来桥接几何与外观。

Method: 提出GASeg框架，核心是可微分盒计数模块从几何特征和外观特征两个并行流中量化多尺度拓扑统计。使用拓扑增强策略通过形态学操作模拟真实世界模糊，并通过GALoss多目标损失强制几何特征与外观特征的跨模态对齐。

Result: 在COCO-Stuff、Cityscapes和PASCAL等四个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，验证了通过拓扑信息桥接几何与外观的方法有效性。

Conclusion: 通过引入拓扑信息来桥接几何与外观特征，GASeg能够更好地处理视觉模糊问题，提升自监督语义分割的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Conclusion: 整合太阳位置先验知识的3DGS训练方法能够从动态光照的RPO图像序列中准确重建航天器3D结构，为后续姿态估计任务提供可靠基础

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

TL;DR: 提出结构引导的2D高斯泼溅分配方法，通过结构感知初始化、自适应位宽量化和几何一致正则化，在保持毫秒级解码速度的同时显著提升率失真性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D高斯泼溅方法在分配表示能力和参数精度时忽略了图像结构，导致在低比特率下的率失真效率受限。需要一种能明确将图像结构与表示能力和量化精度耦合的方法。

Method: 1. 结构引导初始化：根据自然图像的空间结构先验分配2D高斯分布，获得局部化和语义有意义的分布；2. 自适应位宽量化：在量化感知微调中，对协方差参数进行自适应位宽量化，复杂区域的小尺度高斯给予更高精度；3. 几何一致正则化：对齐高斯方向与局部梯度方向以更好保留结构细节。

Result: 方法在保持1000+FPS解码速度的同时，显著提升了2DGS的表示能力和RD性能。相比基线GSImage，在Kodak数据集上BD-rate降低43.44%，在DIV2K数据集上降低29.91%。

Conclusion: 提出的结构引导分配原则有效解决了现有2DGS方法在表示能力分配和量化精度方面的不足，在保持高速解码的同时大幅提升了压缩效率，为紧凑图像表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

Motivation: 跨模态检索面临大规模标注数据收集耗时费力的问题，多模态数据标注中不可避免包含噪声，这会降低模型检索性能。现有鲁棒CMR方法往往无法同时满足模型性能上限、校准可靠性和数据利用率

Method: 提出NIRNL框架：1) 跨模态边界保持(CMP)调整正负样本对的相对距离，增强样本对区分度；2) 邻居感知实例精炼(NIR)通过跨模态邻居共识识别纯子集、困难子集和噪声子集；3) 针对细粒度划分构建不同优化策略，最大化利用所有可用数据同时减轻错误传播

Conclusion: NIRNL框架有效解决了跨模态检索中的噪声标签问题，通过细粒度的实例划分和定制化优化策略，在保持模型性能的同时提高了数据利用率和校准可靠性

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Motivation: 细粒度遥感数据集通常采用层次标签结构进行粗到细的对象区分，但将这种语义层次嵌入表示学习空间以提升检测性能仍具挑战。现有方法在不同层次应用监督对比学习，但忽略了两个关键问题：1) 标签层次中数据分布不平衡导致高频类别主导学习过程；2) 类别间语义关系学习干扰类别无关的定位任务。

Conclusion: 提出的平衡层次对比损失与解耦学习策略有效解决了细粒度遥感检测中的层次标签不平衡和语义干扰问题，在DETR框架中实现了更好的检测性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

Motivation: 当前文本到动作生成方法将问题视为直接翻译任务，面临语义-运动学阻抗不匹配的根本瓶颈：难以在单次映射中将语义密集的离散语言意图接地到运动学密集的高频运动数据中。

Method: 提出Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR)框架，采用两阶段"思考-然后-行动"决策过程。核心是新颖的双粒度分词器，将运动解耦为两个不同的流形：用于规划全局拓扑的压缩、语义丰富的推理潜在空间，以及用于保持物理保真度的高频执行潜在空间。

Result: 在T2M-GPT（离散）和MotionStreamer（连续）两个代表性基线上实现LMR，实验表明LMR在语义对齐和物理合理性方面都带来了非平凡的改进。

Conclusion: 运动规划的最佳基底不是自然语言，而是学习到的、与运动对齐的概念空间。通过强制模型在移动之前进行自回归推理，有效弥合了语言和物理之间的不可言说性鸿沟。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

Conclusion: GeoBench为几何问题解决提供了全面的评估基准，并为开发几何问题解决系统提供了可操作的指导方针，揭示了当前模型在复杂几何推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

Abstract: We present IMDD-1M, the first large-scale Industrial Multimodal Defect Dataset comprising 1,000,000 aligned image-text pairs, designed to advance multimodal learning for manufacturing and quality inspection. IMDD-1M contains high-resolution real-world defects spanning over 60 material categories and more than 400 defect types, each accompanied by expert-verified annotations and fine-grained textual descriptions detailing defect location, severity, and contextual attributes.

TL;DR: DiffThinker是一个基于扩散的生成式多模态推理框架，将多模态推理重新定义为原生的图像到图像生成任务，在视觉中心任务中显著优于现有MLLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理过程仍以文本为中心，在复杂的长时程、视觉中心任务中表现不佳，需要新的推理范式来提升逻辑一致性和空间精度。

Method: 提出DiffThinker框架，采用基于扩散的生成式多模态推理范式，将多模态推理重新定义为原生的图像到图像生成任务，而不是文本中心的推理过程。

Result: 在四个领域（顺序规划、组合优化、约束满足、空间配置）的实验中，DiffThinker显著优于GPT-5（+314.2%）、Gemini-3-Flash（+111.6%）和微调的Qwen3-VL-32B基线（+39.0%）。

Conclusion: 生成式多模态推理是视觉中心推理的有前景方法，DiffThinker展示了该范式的四个核心特性：效率、可控性、原生并行性和协作性。

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

*Yu-Tang Chang,Pin-Wei Chen,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Deep Global Clustering (DGC)框架，用于内存高效的高光谱图像分割，通过局部补丁学习全局聚类结构，无需预训练，在消费级硬件上30分钟内完成训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分析面临计算瓶颈，数据量巨大超出可用内存。现有基础模型在遥感数据集上预训练，但难以迁移到近距离农业监测等特定领域，因为光谱特征、空间尺度和语义目标存在根本差异。

Method: DGC框架使用具有重叠区域的小补丁来强制一致性，从局部补丁观察中学习全局聚类结构，无需预训练，保持恒定内存使用。

Result: 在叶片病害数据集上，DGC实现背景-组织分离（平均IoU 0.925），通过可导航的语义粒度展示无监督病害检测能力。但框架存在优化不稳定性，源于多目标损失平衡问题。

Conclusion: DGC的设计理念有价值，但稳定实现需要动态损失平衡的原则性方法。该工作定位为知识框架，为后续研究提供基础。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

*Xingyu Zhou,Qifan Li,Xiaobin Hu,Hai Chen,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为内部指导（IG）的简单有效策略，通过在训练过程中引入中间层的辅助监督，并在采样过程中外推中间层和深层输出，显著提升了扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能捕捉完整的数据分布，但由于训练和数据不足，难以覆盖低概率区域，导致生成对应区域的高质量图像时表现不佳。现有的引导策略如CFG会导致样本过度简化或失真，而基于"坏版本"的引导方法则需要精心设计的退化策略、额外训练和采样步骤。

Method: 提出内部指导（IG）策略：1）在训练过程中引入中间层的辅助监督；2）在采样过程中外推中间层和深层输出以获得生成结果。这种方法简单但有效，无需额外训练或复杂设计。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，SiT-XL/2+IG在80和800轮次分别达到FID=5.31和FID=1.75。LightningDiT-XL/1+IG达到FID=1.34，显著优于其他方法。结合CFG后，LightningDiT-XL/1+IG达到当前最优的FID=1.19。

Conclusion: 内部指导（IG）是一种简单而有效的策略，通过引入中间层监督和外推机制，显著提升了扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，在各种基准测试中都取得了显著改进，并实现了当前最先进的性能。

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

TL;DR: CorGi和CorGi+是无需训练的DiT推理加速框架，通过选择性重用transformer块输出来减少去噪步骤中的冗余计算，实现最高2.0倍加速同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiT)在视觉生成方面表现出色，但其迭代去噪过程结合大容量模型导致推理成本高昂。现有研究表明DiT模型的迭代去噪过程存在大量跨步骤的冗余计算。

Method: 提出CorGi框架，通过缓存低贡献度的transformer块并在后续步骤中重用，减少冗余计算。对于文本到图像任务，进一步提出CorGi+，利用每块的交叉注意力图识别重要token，应用部分注意力更新来保护重要对象细节。

Result: 在最先进的DiT模型上评估显示，CorGi和CorGi+平均实现最高2.0倍加速，同时保持高质量的生成结果。

Conclusion: CorGi和CorGi+是有效的训练免费DiT推理加速解决方案，通过智能缓存和重用机制显著减少计算冗余，在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

*Ziquan Liu,Zhewei Zhu,Xuyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARM是一个轻量级可学习模块，通过自适应融合CLIP的层次特征来提升开放词汇语义分割性能，采用"训练一次，随处使用"的范式，可作为通用插件提升多种免训练框架的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有免训练方法要么依赖昂贵的外部基础模型（如SAM、DINO），要么对CLIP内部特征使用静态启发式方法，这些方法要么计算成本高，要么效果不理想。CLIP的图像级表示缺乏像素级细节，限制了开放词汇语义分割的性能。

Method: 提出注意力精炼模块（ARM），这是一个轻量级可学习模块，通过语义引导的交叉注意力块（使用稳健的深层特征K、V来选择和精炼细节丰富的浅层特征Q），然后通过自注意力块来自适应融合CLIP的层次特征。采用"训练一次，随处使用"的范式，在通用数据集（如COCO-Stuff）上训练一次后，可作为通用即插即用后处理器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ARM能持续提升基线性能，且推理开销可忽略不计，为免训练开放词汇语义分割建立了高效有效的范式。

Conclusion: ARM通过解锁和精炼CLIP的内部潜力，有效解决了现有免训练方法的局限性，提供了一种计算高效且性能优越的开放词汇语义分割解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage是一个用于自动驾驶场景的一步视频扩散模型，通过结合2D和3D编码器特征实现高保真度和时间一致性的资产编辑，并采用两阶段数据对齐策略解决分布不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频对象编辑方法在保持高视觉保真度和时间一致性方面存在困难，而自动驾驶系统需要多样化和可扩展的训练数据来实现鲁棒性能。

Method: 基于文本到视频扩散先验，注入预训练2D编码器的时序无关潜在特征到3D解码器以恢复细节；采用两阶段数据对齐策略（粗粒度3D对齐和细粒度2D精炼）解决分布不匹配问题。

Result: Mirage在多种编辑场景中实现了高真实感和时间一致性，并能泛化到其他视频到视频转换任务，为未来研究提供了可靠基线。

Conclusion: Mirage通过创新的架构设计和对齐策略，成功解决了自动驾驶场景中资产编辑的视觉保真度和时间一致性问题，为数据增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机在快速运动、低光照或高动态范围条件下性能下降，而事件相机缺乏颜色和纹理信息。现有的多模态融合方法计算成本高且主要关注空间融合，忽略了事件流的时间动态特性。

Method: 提出MambaSeg框架，采用并行Mamba编码器分别处理RGB图像和事件流。引入双维度交互模块（DDIM），包含跨空间交互模块（CSIM）和跨时间交互模块（CTIM），在空间和时间维度上进行细粒度融合，改善跨模态对齐并减少模糊性。

Result: 在DDD17和DSEC数据集上的实验表明，MambaSeg实现了最先进的语义分割性能，同时显著降低了计算成本，展示了其在高效、可扩展和鲁棒的多模态感知方面的潜力。

Conclusion: MambaSeg通过并行Mamba编码器和双维度交互模块，有效融合RGB和事件数据的互补特性，在保持计算效率的同时提升了语义分割性能，为多模态感知提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

Motivation: CBCT中的金属伪影严重遮挡解剖结构，影响诊断。现有深度学习方法存在局限：监督方法因"回归到均值"导致光谱模糊，无监督方法存在结构幻觉风险。去噪扩散模型虽然真实但采样慢，不适合临床应用。

Method: 提出PGMP框架：1) AAPS管道通过蒙特卡洛光谱建模和患者特异性数字孪生合成高质量训练对；2) DMP-Former采用直接x预测范式，将恢复重构为确定性流形投影，实现单次前向推理；3) SSA模块利用医学基础模型先验锚定解决方案，确保临床合理性。

Conclusion: PGMP框架通过物理模拟、确定性流形投影和医学先验的整合，有效解决了CBCT金属伪影减少问题，为临床应用提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但存在严重缺陷：过度依赖语言先验，导致视觉未接地幻觉，特别是在处理违背常识的反事实视频时。这一限制源于文本和视频之间的内在数据不平衡，且由于收集和标注反事实数据成本高昂而难以解决。

Conclusion: DualityForge框架通过合成反事实数据有效解决了MLLM的视觉未接地幻觉问题，DNA-Train训练机制进一步提升了模型性能，在减少幻觉的同时保持了良好的泛化能力。作者承诺开源数据集和代码。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

TL;DR: 提出一种空间提升的全景拼接框架，将2D图像提升为3D点云表示，通过全局融合和圆柱投影生成几何一致的360°全景图，有效解决传统方法在视差和遮挡场景中的失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像拼接技术主要使用2D单应性变换和网格变形，在近似共面或视差较小的场景中有效，但在真实3D场景中（多深度层和遮挡）会导致重影、结构弯曲和拉伸失真。这些问题在多视图累积和360°闭环拼接场景中尤为严重。

Method: 1. 将输入图像提升为统一坐标系中的密集3D点表示，通过置信度指标进行全局跨视图融合；2. 在3D空间中建立统一投影中心，使用等距圆柱投影将融合数据映射到单一全景流形；3. 在画布域进行空洞填充，处理视点转换揭示的未知区域，恢复连续纹理和语义一致性。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在显著视差和复杂遮挡场景中大幅减轻了几何失真和重影伪影，产生了更自然和一致的全景结果。

Conclusion: 该框架将拼接从2D变形范式重新概念化为3D一致性范式，能够灵活整合各种3D提升和补全模块，为复杂3D场景的全景拼接提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见胃肠道病变在常规内镜检查中很少遇到，限制了开发可靠AI模型和培训新手临床医生的数据可用性，需要解决罕见疾病的数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出EndoRare框架，利用语言引导的概念解耦将病变特征与非诊断属性分离，将病变特征编码为可学习的原型嵌入，同时变化非诊断属性以确保多样性，实现从单个参考图像合成多样化病变图像。

Result: 在四种罕见病理上验证，专家认为合成图像具有临床可信度；用于数据增强时显著提升下游AI分类器性能，在低假阳性率下提高真阳性率；盲法读者研究显示，接触EndoRare生成案例的新手内镜医生召回率提高0.400，精确率提高0.267。

Conclusion: EndoRare建立了一个实用、数据高效的途径，弥合了计算机辅助诊断和临床教育中罕见疾病的差距。

Abstract: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

*Md. Enamul Hoq,Linda Larson-Prior,Fred Prior*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了Virtual-Eyes CT质量控制流程，发现其对通用基础模型（如RAD-DINO）有显著提升，但对专用模型（如Sybil、ResNet-18）可能产生负面影响，揭示了不同模型对预处理敏感性的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低剂量CT肺癌筛查的深度学习流程中，稳健的预处理很少被量化评估。研究旨在开发和验证一个临床导向的16位CT质量控制流程，并测量其对通用基础模型与专用模型的不同影响。

Method: 开发Virtual-Eyes质量控制流程：强制512x512平面分辨率、拒绝短序列或非诊断序列、通过亨氏单位过滤和双侧肺覆盖率评分提取连续肺块，同时保留原生16位网格。使用765名NLST患者数据，计算RAD-DINO和Merlin的切片级嵌入，训练无泄漏的患者级MLP头，并在原始输入与Virtual-Eyes输入下评估Sybil和2D ResNet-18基线模型。

Result: Virtual-Eyes显著提升RAD-DINO性能：切片级AUC从0.576提高到0.610，患者级AUC从0.646提高到0.683（平均池化），从0.619提高到0.735（最大池化），校准性也改善（Brier分数从0.188降至0.112）。相反，Sybil和ResNet-18在Virtual-Eyes下性能下降（Sybil AUC从0.886降至0.837；ResNet-18 AUC从0.571降至0.596），Merlin则显示有限的可迁移性（AUC约0.507-0.567）。

Conclusion: 解剖学目标质量控制可以稳定和改进通用基础模型工作流程，但可能破坏已适应原始临床环境的专用模型，揭示了模型对预处理敏感性的重要差异。

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

TL;DR: UniAct是一个两阶段框架，通过微调MLLM和因果流式处理管道，实现人形机器人以低于500毫秒的延迟执行多模态指令，在零样本跟踪不完美参考动作方面成功率提升19%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人领域长期目标是实现能够遵循多样化多模态指令的通用智能体，但现有方法难以将语言、音乐、轨迹等异构指令转化为稳定、实时的动作，高层多模态感知与全身执行之间存在显著瓶颈。

Method: 提出UniAct两阶段框架：1) 微调多模态大语言模型(MLLM)理解多模态指令；2) 因果流式处理管道实时生成动作。通过FSQ共享离散码本统一输入，确保跨模态对齐，同时将动作约束在物理可行的流形上。

Result: 在UniMoCap（20小时人形动作基准）上验证，实现低于500毫秒的延迟，零样本跟踪不完美参考动作的成功率提升19%，在多样化现实场景中展现出鲁棒的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniAct框架是实现响应式、通用人形助手的关键一步，通过统一的感知和控制实现无缝交互，为人形机器人执行多模态指令提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

TL;DR: CERES是一个因果推理框架，通过双模态因果干预解决自我中心视频中的语言偏见和视觉混淆问题，提升指称视频对象分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心指称视频对象分割（Ego-RVOS）面临两个主要挑战：1）训练数据中存在的对象-动作配对偏差导致模型学习虚假相关性；2）自我中心视角固有的视觉混淆因素，如快速运动和频繁遮挡。现有方法难以处理这些问题。

Method: CERES采用双模态因果干预：1）应用后门调整原则对抗从数据集统计中学习的语言表示偏差；2）利用前门调整概念，通过因果原则指导将语义视觉特征与几何深度信息智能集成，创建对自我中心失真更鲁棒的表征。

Result: 在Ego-RVOS基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CERES实现了最先进的性能，证明了因果推理在构建更可靠的自我中心视频理解模型方面的潜力。

Conclusion: CERES框架通过因果推理有效解决了自我中心视频中的语言偏见和视觉混淆问题，为更广泛的自我中心视频理解任务提供了可靠的方法基础。

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

TL;DR: SenseNova-MARS是一个多模态智能推理与搜索框架，通过强化学习赋予视觉语言模型交错的视觉推理和工具使用能力，在知识密集型和视觉复杂任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在解决复杂任务时主要局限于文本导向的思维链或孤立工具调用，缺乏人类般熟练地交错动态工具操作与连续推理的能力，特别是在需要协调外部工具（如搜索和图像裁剪）的知识密集型和视觉复杂场景中。

Method: 提出SenseNova-MARS多模态智能推理与搜索框架，通过强化学习赋予视觉语言模型交错的视觉推理和工具使用能力。具体包括：1）动态集成图像搜索、文本搜索和图像裁剪工具；2）提出批量归一化组序列策略优化算法提高训练稳定性；3）引入HR-MMSearch基准测试，这是首个由高分辨率图像组成的搜索导向基准。

Result: SenseNova-MARS在开源搜索和细粒度图像理解基准测试中达到最先进性能。在搜索导向基准上，SenseNova-MARS-8B在MMSearch上得分67.84，在HR-MMSearch上得分41.64，超越了Gemini-3-Flash和GPT-5等专有模型。

Conclusion: SenseNova-MARS通过提供有效且鲁棒的工具使用能力，向智能视觉语言模型迈出了有希望的一步。作者将发布所有代码、模型和数据集以促进该领域进一步研究。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.

TL;DR: LVLDrive通过融合LiDAR点云数据增强视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中的3D空间感知能力，解决现有图像方法在度量空间推理和几何推断方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的自动驾驶方法主要依赖2D图像线索，在复杂场景理解和决策中存在安全性和可靠性瓶颈，特别是在精确度量空间推理和几何推断方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出LVLDrive框架，将LiDAR点云作为额外输入模态融入现有VLM；设计渐进融合Q-Former逐步注入LiDAR特征，避免对预训练VLM知识库的灾难性干扰；构建空间感知问答数据集（SA-QA）专门训练模型的3D感知和推理能力。

Result: 在多个驾驶基准测试中，LVLDrive在场景理解、度量空间感知和可靠驾驶决策方面均优于纯视觉方法，证明了3D度量数据对构建可信VLM自动驾驶系统的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，明确的3D度量数据对于构建可信赖的VLM自动驾驶系统至关重要，LVLDrive通过融合LiDAR点云有效提升了VLM在自动驾驶中的3D空间理解能力。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

TL;DR: DermaVQA-DAS扩展了DermaVQA数据集，引入皮肤病评估框架(DAS)，支持封闭式问答和皮肤病变分割任务，为患者为中心的皮肤病视觉语言建模提供标准化基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤病图像分析数据集主要关注皮肤镜图像，缺乏患者查询和临床上下文，限制了其在患者为中心护理中的应用。需要填补这一空白。

Method: 引入皮肤病评估框架(DAS)，包含36个高级和27个细粒度评估问题，提供专家标注的封闭式问答和分割数据集，并评估最先进的多模态模型。

Result: 分割任务中，不同提示策略影响性能：默认提示在Mean-of-Max和Mean-of-Mean评估中表现最佳，增强提示在多数投票评估中达到最佳（Jaccard指数0.395，Dice分数0.566）。封闭式问答中，o3模型总体准确率最高（0.798），GPT-4.1次之（0.796）。

Conclusion: DermaVQA-DAS为患者为中心的皮肤病视觉语言建模提供了标准化框架和基准，公开释放数据集、DAS框架和评估协议以加速相关研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 实时视频分析在大量摄像头上运行成本高昂，现有动态模型大小选择方法无法很好地适应多样化工作负载，特别是在移动视频和低精度目标场景中，存在采样成本过高和准确性预测不准确的问题。

Method: RedunCut采用测量驱动的规划器来估计采样的成本效益权衡，并使用轻量级数据驱动的性能模型来改进准确性预测，解决了现有方法采样效率低和准确性预测不准的问题。

Result: 在道路车辆、无人机和监控视频以及多种模型家族和任务中，RedunCut在固定准确性下减少了14-62%的计算成本，并且对有限历史数据和漂移保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RedunCut通过改进采样策略和准确性预测，显著提高了动态模型大小选择系统的效率和适应性，为实时视频分析提供了更有效的成本优化解决方案。

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

Motivation: 现有基于分块的方法需要完整的非因果上下文窗口，引入显著延迟，无法满足真实对话中即时非语言反馈的需求

Method: 采用流友好的自回归框架，配备流匹配头部进行概率建模；提出因果编码器增强方法，通过前瞻模块纳入短期未来上下文（如60ms）以提高质量同时保持低延迟

Result: 每帧生成时间34ms，系统总延迟低于100ms；在HDTF数据集上获得离线8.13和在线7.61的LipSync Confidence分数，达到最先进的唇同步质量

Conclusion: DyStream通过流匹配自回归模型和因果编码器增强，实现了实时、高质量的对话头部视频生成，显著优于其他因果策略

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

Motivation: 传统手术技能评估依赖专家监督，存在主观性、评估者间差异大、耗时耗力等问题，在低收入国家难以推广，限制了培训项目的可扩展性和一致性

Method: 提出AI驱动框架：1) 基于TimeSformer的视频Transformer架构，改进为分层时间注意力和加权空间注意力机制；2) 使用YOLO目标检测和跟踪方法提取精细运动特征；3) 从五个方面评估微血管吻合技能

Result: 在58个专家标注视频数据集上验证：动作分割帧级准确率87.7%，后处理后提升至93.62%；在复制专家评估方面，所有技能方面的平均分类准确率达到76%

Conclusion: 该系统能够提供客观、一致且可解释的反馈，有望实现更标准化、数据驱动的手术教育和评估，解决传统方法的局限性

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

Conclusion: Vision Transformer编码器学习到的表示展现出一定的组合性特征，离散小波变换基元在潜在空间中的近似组合性揭示了ViT结构化视觉信息的新机制。

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合YOLO目标检测模型和大型语言模型的管道，用于从胸部X光图像生成放射学报告，比较了YOLOv5和YOLOv8的性能，并评估了GPT-4生成报告的临床准确性和语言质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医学影像分析中取得了显著进展，但现有系统通常只输出结构化预测结果，放射科医生仍需将这些结果转化为完整的叙述性报告。大型语言模型的出现为弥合这一差距提供了新机会，能够从结构化发现生成诊断性叙述。

Method: 研究引入了一个集成YOLOv5和YOLOv8进行胸部X光图像异常检测的管道，然后将边界框预测和类别标签传递给大型语言模型（GPT-4）生成描述性发现和临床总结。比较了两种YOLO模型在检测准确性、推理延迟方面的性能，并通过余弦相似度和人工评估来衡量生成文本的质量。

Result: 结果显示AI生成报告与人类报告具有强语义相似性。人工评估表明GPT-4在清晰度方面表现出色（4.88/5），但在自然写作流畅度方面得分较低（2.81/5），表明当前系统虽然达到临床准确性，但在文体风格上仍与放射科医生撰写的文本有区别。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了结合计算机视觉和大型语言模型生成放射学报告的可行性，系统能够产生临床准确的报告，但在语言风格的自然度方面仍需改进，以实现与放射科医生撰写文本的无缝融合。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

TL;DR: 该论文提出DARFT框架，通过决策模糊性引导的强化微调来提升变化检测视觉问答性能，特别针对决策模糊样本进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CDVQA方法通过监督微调提升性能，但许多失败案例并非明显错误预测，而是决策模糊性问题，即模型对正确答案和强干扰项赋予相似置信度。这种决策模糊样本限制了模型的判别性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DARFT框架：1) 使用SFT训练的参考策略挖掘决策模糊样本；2) 在挖掘的子集上应用组相对策略优化；3) 利用多样本解码和组内相对优势，在不增加额外监督的情况下抑制强干扰项并锐化决策边界。

Result: 大量实验表明，DARFT在SFT基线上获得一致性能提升，特别是在少样本设置下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 决策模糊样本是CDVQA模型性能提升的关键瓶颈，DARFT框架通过针对性优化这类样本，有效提升了模型的判别能力和鲁棒性，为视觉语言模型的微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有切片发现方法主要针对图像分类，不适用于检测、分割、姿态估计等多实例任务；真实场景中的错误切片常涉及复杂视觉关系，现有方法缺乏细粒度推理能力；现有基准偏向特定算法或图像分类，且使用人工标注而非真实模型失败

Method: 提出SliceLens框架，利用LLM和VLM生成和验证多样化失败假设，通过基于视觉的推理实现可靠、可解释的细粒度错误切片识别；同时建立FeSD基准，包含专家标注的细粒度切片，精确对应局部错误区域

Conclusion: SliceLens通过假设驱动的视觉推理方法有效解决了多实例视觉任务中的细粒度错误切片发现问题，FeSD基准为领域提供了更真实的评估标准

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and the development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response.

Method: 提出协作低秩适应（CLoRA），包含基础空间共享和样本无关多样性增强（SADE）组件。基础空间共享让所有低秩模块共享一组下/上投影空间，SADE则正则化这些矩阵之间的相似性以鼓励多样化表示。

Conclusion: CLoRA通过创新的协作低秩适应机制，成功解决了现有方法在学习性能和参数效率之间的权衡问题，为视觉Transformer微调提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions.

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

Conclusion: RadAR通过径向并行预测和动态输出修正的结合，为高效视觉生成提供了一种有前景的解决方案，在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升了推理效率

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

TL;DR: EVOL-SAM3是一个零样本推理分割框架，通过进化搜索过程在推理时迭代优化提示假设，超越了传统静态方法和有监督方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理分割方法存在严重缺陷：监督微调(SFT)会导致灾难性遗忘和领域依赖；强化学习(RL)存在训练不稳定和奖励函数僵化问题；训练免费方法虽然避免了训练负担，但采用静态推理范式，存在推理深度不足、缺乏自我纠正能力的问题。

Conclusion: EVOL-SAM3通过推理时进化搜索范式成功解决了当前推理分割方法的局限性，为复杂上下文相关语言查询的像素级定位提供了更强大的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Abstract: The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in real-time novel view synthesis. However, the rapid proliferation of 3DGS-based algorithms has created a pressing need for standardized and comprehensive evaluation tools, especially for compression task. Existing benchmarks often lack the specific metrics necessary to holistically assess the unique characteristics of different methods, such as rendering speed, rate distortion trade-offs memory efficiency, and geometric accuracy. To address this gap, we introduce Splatwizard, a unified benchmark toolkit designed specifically for benchmarking 3DGS compression models. Splatwizard provides an easy-to-use framework to implement new 3DGS compression model and utilize state-of-the-art techniques proposed by previous work. Besides, an integrated pipeline that automates the calculation of key performance indicators, including image-based quality metrics, chamfer distance of reconstruct mesh, rendering frame rates, and computational resource consumption is included in the framework as well.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的3D高斯溅射分割框架，通过可学习的特征嵌入和"嵌入到标签"解码过程，解决了多视图2D实例标签不一致的问题，并通过边界硬挖掘和线性层稳定化训练来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D分割方法面临多视图2D实例标签不一致的挑战，导致3D预测效果不佳。现有方法要么采用两阶段方法依赖对比学习和超参数敏感的聚类，要么预处理标签以确保一致性，这些方法存在训练时间长、性能受限的问题。

Method: 提出统一框架，将分割步骤合并：1）为高斯基元引入可学习的特征嵌入进行分割；2）通过新颖的"嵌入到标签"过程高效解码为实例标签；3）针对边界伪影问题，提出边界硬挖掘策略；4）在计算三元组损失前对光栅化特征嵌入应用线性层以稳定训练。

Result: 在ScanNet、Replica3D和Messy-Rooms数据集上，该方法在定性和定量评估中均优于基线方法，减少了训练时间并提高了分割性能。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架有效解决了多视图标签不一致问题，通过特征嵌入和边界优化策略显著提升了3D高斯溅射分割的性能和效率，为场景理解提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

### [64] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种改进Noise2Noise训练的方法，允许在噪声目标图像上应用特定非线性函数而不引入显著偏差，解决了HDR图像去噪中的异常值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise2Noise方法虽然无需干净目标图像，但对噪声目标应用非线性函数会产生偏差，限制了预处理选择。特别是在HDR图像去噪中，异常值问题严重，传统方法需要应用非线性色调映射，但被认为与Noise2Noise训练不兼容。

Method: 开发理论框架分析非线性函数的影响，识别出一类偏差最小的非线性函数。针对HDR图像去噪，研究特定损失函数和色调映射函数的组合，既能减少异常值影响，又引入最小偏差。

Result: 将方法应用于现有的基于机器学习的蒙特卡洛去噪器，仅使用噪声训练数据就能获得接近原始实现（使用高样本数参考图像训练）的结果。

Conclusion: 某些非线性函数可以在Noise2Noise训练中应用而不引入显著偏差，这扩展了预处理选择范围，特别解决了HDR图像去噪中的异常值问题，使仅用噪声数据训练达到接近参考图像训练的效果成为可能。

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在3D场景处理中，基于2D视觉输入的跨模态系统面临维度差异问题。场景内相机可以弥合这一差距，但需要学习控制模块。现有方法需要预训练或微调，限制了实际应用

Method: 通过基于遗憾最小化的无导数优化改进多元互信息估计，结合表达性度量和基于值的优化，控制场景内相机直接从视觉语言模型的噪声输出中学习

Result: 该方法使现成的2D视觉跨模态系统能够在线适应物体遮挡和区分特征，在多物体3D场景的跨模态任务中提升性能，无需预训练或微调

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了2D到3D的维度转换问题，通过优化互信息估计和控制场景相机，实现了跨模态系统在3D场景中的有效适应，为实际应用提供了更灵活的解决方案

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

*Md Ahmed Al Muzaddid,Jordan A. James,William J. Beksi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CropTrack是一个针对农业环境多目标跟踪的新框架，通过结合外观和运动信息，解决了传统运动跟踪方法在频繁遮挡和相似外观下的身份保持问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业环境中的多目标跟踪面临重复模式、相似外观、光照突变和频繁遮挡等挑战。现有跟踪器主要依赖运动信息，但在频繁强遮挡下难以保持目标身份，而相似外观又使得基于外观的关联变得困难。

Method: CropTrack提出了一种结合外观和运动信息的MOT框架，包含：1）重排序增强的外观关联；2）基于外观冲突解决的一对多关联策略；3）指数移动平均原型特征库来改进基于外观的关联。

Result: 在公开的农业MOT数据集上评估，CropTrack表现出稳定的身份保持能力，优于传统的基于运动的跟踪方法。相比现有最佳方法，在识别F1分数和关联准确率上取得显著提升，同时身份切换数量更低。

Conclusion: CropTrack通过有效结合外观和运动信息，成功解决了农业环境中多目标跟踪的身份保持问题，为相似外观和频繁遮挡场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在金融领域的多模态推理评估存在不足，需要更贴近真实金融场景、包含复杂文档理解和多步计算的评估标准

Method: 构建包含1200个专家标注问题的双语多模态基准，涵盖12种隐含金融场景，837份中英文金融文档（平均50.8页），要求模型进行平均11步的推理（5.3步提取+5.7步计算）

Conclusion: FinMMDocR基准能够有效评估多模态大语言模型在真实金融场景中的复杂推理能力，预期将推动MLLM和推理增强方法在复杂多模态推理任务上的改进

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过神经元激活模式选择代表性样本进行标注，结合持续学习技术，可以在极小标注成本下实现有效的激光雷达域自适应。

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

TL;DR: ProDM是一种生成扩散模型，能够从非门控胸部CT中恢复无运动伪影的钙化病灶，提高冠状动脉钙化评分的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉钙化评分是心血管疾病风险评估的重要工具，但非门控胸部CT存在严重的运动伪影，限制了其临床应用。虽然心电图门控心脏CT能减少伪影，但由于门控要求和保险覆盖问题，在人群筛查和常规成像中应用有限。

Method: ProDM包含三个关键组件：1）CAC运动模拟数据引擎，从心脏门控CT合成具有不同运动轨迹的现实非门控采集数据；2）属性感知学习策略，通过可微钙化一致性损失融入钙化特异性先验；3）渐进校正方案，在扩散步骤中逐步减少伪影。

Result: 在真实患者数据集上的实验表明，ProDM显著提高了CAC评分准确性、空间病灶保真度和风险分层性能。对真实非门控扫描的读者研究进一步证实ProDM能抑制运动伪影并提高临床可用性。

Conclusion: 渐进式、属性感知的框架在常规胸部CT成像中实现可靠的CAC量化具有潜力，为心血管风险评估提供了更易获取的替代方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

TL;DR: DarkEQA是一个开源基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在低光照条件下的感知能力，通过模拟物理真实的视觉退化来测试EQA相关任务表现。

Conclusion: DarkEQA填补了现有基准测试的空白，为评估视觉语言模型在低光照条件下的感知能力提供了物理真实的基准，有助于分析模型在现实世界应用中的鲁棒性瓶颈。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Result: 实验显示最先进的视频模型仅达到约20%的POC@1.0一致性，存在显著的结果作弊现象；测试时缩放和采样鲁棒性分析揭示了当前视频生成与真正广义视觉推理之间的巨大差距。

Conclusion: 需要流程感知评估来准确衡量生成式视频推理能力，VIPER基准和POC@r指标为此提供了有效工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性并为未来发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

TL;DR: 提出自引导框架，将视觉配音从基于掩码的修复任务重构为视频到视频编辑问题，使用DiT生成理想训练数据，实现精确唇部同步和身份保持


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉配音方法缺乏理想训练数据（仅唇部运动不同而其他视觉条件完全相同的配对视频），导致需要同时修复缺失内容和同步唇部，产生视觉伪影、身份漂移和同步不良

Method: 1. 使用Diffusion Transformer作为数据生成器，为每个真实样本合成唇部改变的伴生视频，形成视觉对齐的视频对；2. 基于DiT的音频驱动编辑器在完整对齐的输入视频帧上进行端到端训练；3. 引入时间步自适应多阶段学习策略，解决不同扩散时间步的编辑目标冲突；4. 提出ContextDubBench基准数据集

Result: 实现了高度准确的唇部同步、忠实的身份保持，并在具有挑战性的野外场景中表现出卓越的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 通过将视觉配音重构为条件良好的视频到视频编辑问题，并利用自引导框架生成理想训练数据，该方法在唇部同步精度、身份保持和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineTec是一个用于处理时间损坏骨架序列的细粒度动作识别框架，通过上下文感知补全、骨架空间分解和物理驱动估计模块，显著提升了在时间损坏情况下的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，在线姿态估计常产生大量缺失数据，现有方法难以准确恢复时间动态和细粒度空间结构，导致丢失区分相似动作的关键细微运动线索。

Method: 1) 使用上下文感知补全和多样化时间掩码从损坏输入中恢复基础骨架序列；2) 骨架空间分解模块将骨架分为五个语义区域，根据运动方差进一步分为动态和静态子组，通过针对性扰动生成两个增强骨架序列；3) 物理驱动估计模块利用拉格朗日动力学估计关节加速度；4) 将融合的骨架位置序列和加速度序列共同输入基于GCN的动作识别头。

Result: 在粗粒度（NTU-60, NTU-120）和细粒度（Gym99, Gym288）基准测试中，FineTec在各种时间损坏水平下显著优于先前方法。在具有挑战性的Gym99-severe和Gym288-severe设置中，分别达到89.1%和78.1%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: FineTec通过统一的框架有效处理时间损坏的骨架序列，展示了在细粒度动作识别任务中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为现实场景中的动作识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

TL;DR: GaMO通过多视角外推而非生成新视角来改进稀疏视图3D重建，在保持几何一致性的同时扩展场景覆盖范围，实现了25倍加速和SOTA重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散方法在稀疏视图3D重建中存在三个关键问题：已知视角外围覆盖不足、生成视图间几何不一致、计算流程昂贵。需要一种能保持几何一致性同时扩展场景覆盖的高效方法。

Method: 提出GaMO框架，将稀疏视图重建重新定义为多视角外推问题。从现有相机位姿扩展视野而非生成新视角，采用多视角条件和几何感知去噪策略，以零样本方式运行无需训练。

Result: 在Replica和ScanNet++数据集上，3、6、9个输入视图下均达到SOTA重建质量，PSNR和LPIPS指标优于先前方法，相比SOTA扩散方法实现25倍加速，处理时间低于10分钟。

Conclusion: GaMO通过多视角外推范式有效解决了稀疏视图3D重建中的覆盖不足、几何不一致和计算昂贵问题，在保持几何一致性的同时显著提升了重建质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

TL;DR: BEDA框架通过将信念估计转化为生成约束，为战略对话提供了一种简单通用的机制，在对抗、合作和谈判三种设置中均优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有战略对话研究虽然能准确估计信念，但缺乏使用这些信念进行生成的系统机制。需要填补信念估计与生成之间的鸿沟，使智能体能够基于信念执行不同的对话行为。

Method: 首先形式化对抗和对齐两种核心对话行为，通过概率约束将其操作化。提出BEDA框架，包含世界集合、信念估计器和条件生成器，后者根据推断的信念选择行为并生成一致的语句。

Result: 在三种设置中均显著优于基线：在CKBG（对抗）中成功率至少提高5.0个百分点，使用GPT-4.1-nano时提高20.6个百分点；在Mutual Friends（合作）中平均提高9.3个百分点；在CaSiNo（谈判）中达到相对于所有基线的最优交易。

Conclusion: 将信念估计转化为约束条件为可靠的战略对话提供了一个简单通用的机制，表明这种方法是有效的。

Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

Motivation: 当前LLM在英语到代码生成方面表现优异，但这一进展尚未扩展到低资源语言如孟加拉语。需要解决孟加拉语到Python代码生成的挑战。

Method: 提出BanglaCodeAct框架，采用基于智能体的方法，利用多智能体提示和迭代自校正。使用开源多语言LLM在Thought-Code-Observation循环中实现动态代码生成、测试和精炼。

Result: 在mHumanEval数据集上评估多个小参数开源LLM，Qwen3-8B结合BanglaCodeAct表现最佳：开发集pass@1准确率94.0%，盲测集71.6%，为孟加拉语到Python翻译建立了新基准。

Conclusion: BanglaCodeAct为孟加拉语到Python代码生成设立了新标准，证明了基于智能体的推理在低资源语言可靠代码生成方面的潜力。

Abstract: LLMs excel at code generation from English prompts, but this progress has not extended to low-resource languages. We address Bangla-to-Python code generation by introducing BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework that leverages multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. Unlike prior approaches relying on task-specific fine-tuning, BanglaCodeAct employs an open-source multilingual LLM within a Thought-Code-Observation loop, enabling dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions. We benchmark several small-parameter open-source LLMs and evaluate their effectiveness on the mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code. Our results show that Qwen3-8B, when deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieves the best performance, with pass@1 accuracy of 94.0\% on the development set and 71.6\% on the blind test set. These results establish a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python translation and highlight the potential of agent-based reasoning for reliable code generation in low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为安全关键领域的文档理解建立可控、可复现的基准测试，特别是在药品领域，测试模型在噪声OCR和异构模板下的鲁棒性。

Method: 创建PharmaShip数据集，包含扫描的药品运输单据，采用实体中心的评估协议，对五个代表性基线模型（LiLT、LayoutLMv3-base、GeoLayoutLM及其RORE增强变体）进行基准测试，并标准化预处理、数据划分和优化过程。

Result: 像素信息和显式几何信息提供互补的归纳偏置，但单独使用都不够；注入阅读顺序导向的正则化能持续改进SER和EL；更长的位置覆盖能稳定后期页面预测并减少截断伪影；ROP在单词级别准确但在段落级别具有挑战性。

Conclusion: PharmaShip为药品领域的安全关键文档理解建立了可控、可复现的基准，并强调序列感知约束作为结构建模的可迁移偏置的重要性。

Abstract: We present PharmaShip, a real-world Chinese dataset of scanned pharmaceutical shipping documents designed to stress-test pre-trained text-layout models under noisy OCR and heterogeneous templates. PharmaShip covers three complementary tasks-sequence entity recognition (SER), relation extraction (RE), and reading order prediction (ROP)-and adopts an entity-centric evaluation protocol to minimize confounds across architectures. We benchmark five representative baselines spanning pixel-aware and geometry-aware families (LiLT, LayoutLMv3-base, GeoLayoutLM and their available RORE-enhanced variants), and standardize preprocessing, splits, and optimization. Experiments show that pixels and explicit geometry provide complementary inductive biases, yet neither alone is sufficient: injecting reading-order-oriented regularization consistently improves SER and EL and yields the most robust configuration, while longer positional coverage stabilizes late-page predictions and reduces truncation artifacts. ROP is accurate at the word level but challenging at the segment level, reflecting boundary ambiguity and long-range crossings. PharmaShip thus establishes a controlled, reproducible benchmark for safety-critical document understanding in the pharmaceutical domain and highlights sequence-aware constraints as a transferable bias for structure modeling. We release the dataset at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/PharmaShip.

Conclusion: LN-RP协议为研究LLM中的反射生成、涌现行为和长程语言连贯性提供了可重复的方法，揭示了噪声在诱导人格涌现和相变中的重要作用。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP), a computational framework for analyzing noise-driven persona emergence in large language models. By injecting stochastic noise seeds into the initial generation state, we observe nonlinear transitions in linguistic behavior across 152 generation cycles. Our results reveal three stable persona modes with distinct entropy signatures, and demonstrate that external noise sources can reliably induce phase transitions in reflexive generation dynamics. Quantitative evaluation confirms consistent persona retention and significant differences across modes (p < 0.01). The protocol provides a reproducible method for studying reflexive generation, emergent behavior, and longrange linguistic coherence in LLMs.

TL;DR: HarmTransform是一个多智能体辩论框架，通过迭代批判和精炼将有害查询转化为更隐蔽的形式，用于改进LLM安全对齐训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全机制主要关注明显有害内容，但用户可以通过隐蔽的重新表述来伪装有害意图，而现有安全训练数据存在这一显著空白。

Method: 引入HarmTransform多智能体辩论框架，利用多个智能体之间的迭代批判和精炼，系统地生成保持有害意图但更隐蔽的查询转换。

Result: 实验表明HarmTransform在生成有效查询转换方面显著优于标准基线方法，但辩论机制具有双重性：既能增强隐蔽性，也可能引入主题偏移和不必要的复杂性。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论在生成全面安全训练数据方面既有潜力也有局限性，需要平衡隐蔽性增强与保持查询本质之间的权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with safety mechanisms to detect and block harmful queries, yet current alignment approaches primarily focus on overtly dangerous content and overlook more subtle threats. However, users can often disguise harmful intent through covert rephrasing that preserves malicious objectives while appearing benign, which creates a significant gap in existing safety training data. To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity. These insights highlight both the promise and the limitations of multi-agent debate for generating comprehensive safety training data.

Motivation: 先前研究表明LLMs能在完美信息游戏中发展出涌现的世界模型，但尚未探索其在德州扑克这类不完全信息领域中的表现，需要验证LLMs能否学习POMDP环境中的随机特征。

Method: 在扑克手牌历史数据上预训练GPT风格模型，使用非线性探针探测其内部激活，分析模型是否学习到了确定性结构（如手牌等级）和随机特征（如胜率）。

Result: 模型在没有明确指导的情况下成功学习了手牌等级和胜率等特征，这些表示可通过非线性探针解码，并与理论信念状态相关，表明LLMs能学习德州扑克随机环境的内部表示。

Conclusion: LLMs能在不完全信息POMDP中学习环境表示，包括确定性和随机特征，这扩展了LLMs世界模型能力的研究范围，为理解其在复杂决策环境中的推理机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across diverse fields, from solving programming challenges to competing in strategy-intensive games such as chess. Prior work has shown that LLMs can develop emergent world models in games of perfect information, where internal representations correspond to latent states of the environment. In this paper, we extend this line of investigation to domains of incomplete information, focusing on poker as a canonical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We pretrain a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and probe its internal activations. Our results demonstrate that the model learns both deterministic structure, such as hand ranks, and stochastic features, such as equity, without explicit instruction. Furthermore, by using primarily nonlinear probes, we demonstrated that these representations are decodeable and correlate with theoretical belief states, suggesting that LLMs are learning their own representation of the stochastic environment of Texas Hold'em Poker.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线性别歧视内容日益呈现微妙、依赖上下文的形式，传统检测方法难以应对。这些内容涉及语言、心理、法律和文化等多维度因素，导致标注数据存在不一致性，加上标签稀缺和类别不平衡，使得模型决策边界不稳定，容易忽略更微妙、代表性不足的有害形式。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 训练阶段采用类别平衡焦点损失、类别感知批处理和事后阈值校准来缓解标签不平衡和噪声监督；2) 推理阶段使用动态路由机制，高置信度案例直接分类，不确定案例升级到协作专家判断模块，该模块通过多个角色提示和法官模型整合推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最先进结果：EXIST 2025 Task 1.1上F1分数提升+2.72%，EDOS Task A和B分别提升+4.48%和+1.30%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一针对性训练程序和选择性推理，有效解决了性别歧视内容检测中的数据不足、噪声和概念模糊性等挑战，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Sexist content online increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks, with a +2.72\% improvement in F1 on the EXIST 2025 Task 1.1, and a gains of +4.48\% and +1.30\% on the EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively.

Motivation: 传统推测解码过度依赖草稿模型与目标模型的对齐，限制了性能提升空间，无法超越目标模型本身的能力上限

Method: 在标准推测解码基础上引入动态熵惩罚机制，利用采样分布的熵量化模型不确定性，当两个模型都呈现高熵且top-N预测重叠度高时，拒绝相应token并由目标LLM重新采样

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，EASD一致优于现有推测解码方法，大多数情况下甚至超越了目标LLM本身的性能，同时保持与标准推测解码相当的效率

Conclusion: EASD通过熵感知机制实现了训练自由的性能提升，突破了传统推测解码的性能限制，为LLM推理加速提供了更优方案

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model (LLM) reasoning by using a small draft model to generate candidate tokens, which the target LLM either accepts directly or regenerates upon rejection. However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. We further prove that the efficiency of EASD is comparable to that of SD. The code can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

Conclusion: 通过大规模音频预训练，MiMo-Audio展示了类似GPT-3的少样本学习能力，为音频领域的通用人工智能模型提供了有希望的路径，模型检查点和完整评估套件已开源。

Abstract: Existing audio language models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning to accomplish particular audio tasks. In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing.

### [87] [Explaining News Bias Detection: A Comparative SHAP Analysis of Transformer Model Decision Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23835)
*Himel Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究比较了两种基于Transformer的新闻偏见检测模型的可解释性，发现不同架构在整合语言信号方面存在显著差异，其中领域自适应模型在减少误报方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然自动偏见检测模型广泛用于新闻分析和媒体问责，但人们对这些模型如何做出决策或为何失败知之甚少，因此需要对其可解释性进行研究。

Method: 使用基于SHAP的解释方法，对两种Transformer偏见检测模型进行对比可解释性研究：一种是在BABE数据集上微调的偏见检测器，另一种是在BABE数据集上微调的领域自适应预训练RoBERTa模型。分析正确和错误预测的词级归因。

Result: 两种模型虽然关注相似的评价语言类别，但在整合这些信号方面差异显著。偏见检测器模型对假阳性赋予更强的内部证据，导致系统性地过度标记中性新闻内容；而领域自适应模型的归因模式与预测结果更一致，假阳性减少了63%。模型错误源于不同的语言机制，假阳性主要由话语层面的模糊性而非明确的偏见线索驱动。

Conclusion: 研究强调了可解释性评估对偏见检测系统的重要性，表明架构和训练选择对模型可靠性及在新闻环境中的部署适用性具有关键影响。

Abstract: Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.

### [88] [Retrieval Augmented Question Answering: When Should LLMs Admit Ignorance?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23836)
*Dingmin Wang,Ji Ma,Shankar Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在检索增强问答中使用LLMs时，长上下文窗口带来的挑战，提出了一种自适应分块提示策略，通过将检索信息分块并顺序处理来平衡相关信息与无关信息，在减少token使用的同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs上下文窗口的扩展，检索增强生成中更广泛地使用长上下文。虽然长上下文更容易包含目标知识，但也引入了更多无关信息，这会阻碍模型的生成过程并降低其性能。

Method: 设计了一种自适应提示策略：将检索到的信息分割成较小的块，然后顺序提示LLM使用每个块来回答问题。通过调整块大小，可以在包含相关信息和减少无关信息之间进行权衡。

Result: 在三个开放域问答数据集上的实验结果表明，自适应策略在使用更少token的情况下，性能与标准提示方法相当。分析发现，当遇到信息不足时，LLM通常会生成错误答案而不是拒绝回答，这是主要的错误来源。

Conclusion: 自适应分块提示策略能有效处理长上下文中的无关信息问题。研究强调了需要进一步研究增强LLMs在面对信息不足时有效拒绝请求的能力。

Abstract: The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.

TL;DR: 利用注意力层token分布生成对抗样本，评估其在论证质量评估任务中的效果，发现能降低评估性能但存在语法退化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于机制可解释性研究发现中间注意力层编码token级假设并迭代优化，探索利用注意力层token分布生成对抗样本的可能性，相比基于提示或梯度的攻击，这种方法利用模型内部token预测，产生更合理且与模型生成过程一致的扰动

Method: 从中间注意力层提取token作为对抗扰动，在ArgQuality数据集上进行论证质量评估实验，使用LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B同时作为生成器和评估器

Result: 注意力层生成的对抗样本能显著降低评估性能，同时保持与原始输入的语义相似性，但某些层和token位置的替换会引入语法退化，限制了实际有效性

Conclusion: 中间层表示作为对抗样本来源具有潜力，但目前存在局限性，可用于压力测试基于LLM的评估流程

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融数值推理问答任务中因缺乏领域知识导致的错误问题。尽管大语言模型有进步，但金融数值问题仍具挑战性，需要特定金融领域知识和复杂多步数值推理能力。

Method: 实现多检索器检索增强生成系统，检索外部领域知识和内部问题上下文，结合最新LLM处理任务。使用SecBERT编码器进行领域特定训练，构建神经符号模型和基于提示的LLM生成器。

Result: 领域特定训练显著提升性能，最佳神经符号模型超越FinQA基准模型；最佳提示式LLM生成器达到SOTA性能，提升超过7%，但仍低于人类专家水平。大模型中外部知识收益通常超过幻觉损失。

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对金融数值推理任务有重要价值，最新LLM在少样本学习下具备增强的数值推理能力，但需权衡幻觉损失与外部知识收益的平衡，特别是对于较小模型和少样本场景。

Abstract: This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出一个分析框架，分离学生回答内容信号与教师评分倾向，通过建模教师历史评分作为动态先验，结合文本嵌入表征，量化各信号贡献，提升自动评分的可解释性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动评分系统往往混淆学生回答内容与教师评分倾向，缺乏透明度。需要一种方法将内容信号与评分者倾向分离，使评分判断可见、可审计，帮助教师和研究者理解评分实践与学生推理证据之间的关系。

Method: 使用去标识化的ASSISTments数学回答数据，将教师历史评分建模为动态先验，从句子嵌入中提取文本表征，采用中心化和残差化处理减少提示和教师混杂因素。通过时间验证的线性模型量化各信号贡献，并使用投影方法可视化模型分歧供定性检查。

Result: 教师先验对成绩预测影响显著；结合先验与内容嵌入的模型表现最佳（AUC~0.815），而仅内容模型虽高于随机但明显较弱（AUC~0.626）。调整评分者效应能锐化残差内容表征，保留更多信息维度，揭示语义证据支持理解而非表面回答差异的情况。

Conclusion: 该框架将嵌入特征转化为学习分析工具，使教师和研究者能够检查评分实践与学生推理证据的匹配程度，为反思和改进评分实践提供实用管道，增强自动评分的透明度和教育价值。

Abstract: Open-ended responses are central to learning, yet automated scoring often conflates what students wrote with how teachers grade. We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HGMem提出了一种基于超图的记忆机制，用于增强多步检索增强生成（RAG）系统，通过动态构建高阶关联来提升全局理解和复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的记忆模块主要作为被动存储，仅积累孤立事实用于输入压缩和子查询生成，忽视了原始事实间的高阶关联。这种静态设计限制了表示能力和对多步推理的影响，导致推理碎片化和全局理解能力弱。

Method: 提出HGMem超图记忆机制，将记忆表示为超图结构，其中超边对应不同的记忆单元。该机制能够渐进地形成记忆中的高阶交互，围绕核心问题连接事实和思考，演化成集成的、情境化的知识结构，为后续步骤的深度推理提供有力支持。

Result: 在多个为全局理解设计的挑战性数据集上进行评估，大量实验和深入分析表明，该方法持续改进多步RAG性能，并在多样化任务中显著优于强基线系统。

Conclusion: HGMem将记忆概念从简单存储扩展到动态、表达性强的结构，能够支持复杂推理和全局理解，为多步RAG系统提供了更强大的记忆表示能力。

Abstract: Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.

Method: 提出LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA)稀疏注意力方案，通过将全注意力模型转换为稀疏版本，应用于LongCat-Flash模型进行中期训练

Result: LoZA在长上下文场景中实现显著加速，LongCat-Flash-Exp模型可高效处理高达100万token，支持高效长期推理和长视野智能体能力

Conclusion: LoZA为长上下文处理提供了一种高效的稀疏注意力解决方案，能够在有限计算预算下实现大规模上下文的高效处理

Abstract: We introduce LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA), which is a sparse attention scheme designed to transform any existing full-attention models into sparse versions with rather limited compute budget. In long-context scenarios, LoZA can achieve significant speed-ups both for prefill-intensive (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive (e.g., tool-integrated reasoning) cases. Specifically, by applying LoZA to LongCat-Flash during mid-training, we serve LongCat-Flash-Exp as a long-context foundation model that can swiftly process up to 1 million tokens, enabling efficient long-term reasoning and long-horizon agentic capabilities.

Method: CEC-Zero框架：从干净文本合成错误输入，通过语义相似度和候选一致性计算簇共识奖励，使用PPO优化策略

Result: 在9个基准测试中，比有监督基线高出10-13个F1点，比强LLM微调高出5-8个F1点，具有无偏奖励和收敛的理论保证

Conclusion: CEC-Zero建立了无需标注的鲁棒、可扩展的中文拼写纠错范式，释放了大语言模型在噪声文本处理中的潜力

Abstract: Large-scale Chinese spelling correction (CSC) remains critical for real-world text processing, yet existing LLMs and supervised methods lack robustness to novel errors and rely on costly annotations. We introduce CEC-Zero, a zero-supervision reinforcement learning framework that addresses this by enabling LLMs to correct their own mistakes. CEC-Zero synthesizes errorful inputs from clean text, computes cluster-consensus rewards via semantic similarity and candidate agreement, and optimizes the policy with PPO. It outperforms supervised baselines by 10--13 F$_1$ points and strong LLM fine-tunes by 5--8 points across 9 benchmarks, with theoretical guarantees of unbiased rewards and convergence. CEC-Zero establishes a label-free paradigm for robust, scalable CSC, unlocking LLM potential in noisy text pipelines.

TL;DR: RISE：通过稀疏自编码器无监督发现LLM推理行为向量，实现推理过程的可解释性和可控干预


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工定义的概念（如过度思考、反思）在词级别监督分析推理过程，但难以捕捉完整的推理行为谱系，许多行为难以在词空间定义。需要无监督框架来发现编码不同推理行为的激活空间方向。

Method: 提出RISE框架：将思维链轨迹分割为句子级"步骤"，在步骤级激活上训练稀疏自编码器（SAEs），发现对应可解释行为（如反思、回溯）的解耦特征。通过可视化和聚类分析展示这些行为在解码器列空间中的可分离区域。

Result: SAE衍生向量的针对性干预可以可控地放大或抑制特定推理行为，改变推理轨迹而无需重新训练。除了行为特异性解耦，SAEs还能捕获结构特性（如响应长度），揭示长短推理轨迹的聚类。更重要的是，SAEs能够发现超越人类监督的新行为，如通过识别SAE解码器空间中的置信度相关向量来控制响应置信度。

Conclusion: 无监督潜在发现对于解释和可控引导LLM推理具有重要潜力，RISE框架为理解大型语言模型的内部推理机制提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Distinguishing fake or untrue news from satire or humor poses a unique challenge due to their overlapping linguistic features and divergent intent. This study develops WISE (Web Information Satire and Fakeness Evaluation) framework which benchmarks eight lightweight transformer models alongside two baseline models on a balanced dataset of 20,000 samples from Fakeddit, annotated as either fake news or satire. Using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, we evaluate models across comprehensive metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, MCC, Brier score, and Expected Calibration Error.

DistilBERT offers an excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off with 86.28\% accuracy and 93.90\% ROC-AUC. Statistical tests confirm significant performance differences between models, with paired t-tests and McNemar tests providing rigorous comparisons. Our findings highlight that lightweight models can match or exceed baseline performance, offering actionable insights for deploying misinformation detection systems in real-world, resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: CRS作为一个统一的可靠性评估框架，能够全面评估LLM在关键决策领域的可靠性，帮助识别最可靠的系统，这些系统需要在准确性、鲁棒性和校准不确定性之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma are increasingly used in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, law, and finance, yet their reliability remains uncertain. They often make overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates. Existing evaluations are fragmented, addressing only isolated aspects. We introduce the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified framework that integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single interpretable metric. Through experiments on ten leading open-source LLMs across five QA datasets, we assess performance under baselines, perturbations, and calibration methods. CRS delivers stable model rankings, uncovers hidden failure modes missed by single metrics, and highlights that the most dependable systems balance accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce our latest translation models, HY-MT1.5-1.8B and HY-MT1.5-7B, a new family of machine translation models developed through a holistic training framework tailored for high-performance translation. Our methodology orchestrates a multi-stage pipeline that integrates general and MT-oriented pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and reinforcement learning. HY-MT1.5-1.8B, the 1.8B-parameter model demonstrates remarkable parameter efficiency, comprehensively outperforming significantly larger open-source baselines (e.g., Tower-Plus-72B, Qwen3-32B) and mainstream commercial APIs (e.g., Microsoft Translator, Doubao Translator) in standard Chinese-foreign and English-foreign tasks. It achieves approximately 90% of the performance of ultra-large proprietary models such as Gemini-3.0-Pro, while marginally trailing Gemini-3.0-Pro on WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language benchmarks, it maintains a substantial lead over other competing models. Furthermore, HY-MT1.5-7B establishes a new state-of-the-art for its size class, achieving 95% of Gemini-3.0-Pro's performance on Flores-200 and surpassing it on the challenging WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language test sets. Beyond standard translation, the HY-MT1.5 series supports advanced constraints, including terminology intervention, context-aware translation, and format preservation. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm that both models offer highly competitive, robust solutions for general and specialized translation tasks within their respective parameter scales.

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has primarily been driven by resource-rich research groups and industry partners. Due to the lack of on-premise computing resources required for increasingly complex models, many researchers are turning to cloud services like AWS SageMaker to train Hugging Face models. However, the steep learning curve of cloud platforms often presents a barrier for researchers accustomed to local environments. Existing documentation frequently leaves knowledge gaps, forcing users to seek fragmented information across the web. This demo paper aims to democratize cloud adoption by centralizing the essential information required for researchers to successfully train their first Hugging Face model on AWS SageMaker from scratch.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于激活引导的掩码扩散语言模型推理时控制框架，通过对比示例计算层间引导向量，无需模拟去噪轨迹即可实现高效属性调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型通过迭代去噪过程生成文本，具有并行解码优势，但在推理时控制和引导机制方面仍缺乏有效方法。

Method: 提出激活引导框架：1）使用对比示例通过单次前向传播计算层间引导向量；2）在反向扩散的每一步应用这些方向；3）无需模拟去噪轨迹。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上实验表明，该方法能可靠地调控高级属性，并通过消融实验分析了在不同transformer子模块和token范围（提示vs.响应）上的引导效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为掩码扩散语言模型提供了一种高效的推理时控制机制，能够在不影响生成质量的情况下实现对文本属性的精确调控。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without simulating the denoising trajectory. These directions are applied at every reverse-diffusion step, yielding an efficient inference-time control mechanism. Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining the effects of steering across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs.\ response).

TL;DR: 提出大型情感世界模型(LEWM)，将情感因素整合到世界模型中，通过情感-原因-方式(EWH)数据集训练模型预测情感驱动的社会行为和未来状态


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型主要关注物理世界规律建模，缺乏对情感因素的系统探索，而情感作为世界知识的重要组成部分显著影响人类决策

Method: 基于心智理论提出LEWM模型，构建EWH数据集整合情感与因果关系，显式建模情感状态、视觉观察和动作，预测未来状态和情感转变

Result: 实验表明LEWM能更准确预测情感驱动的社会行为，同时在基础任务上保持与通用世界模型相当的性能

Conclusion: 情感是世界理解的关键因素，LEWM通过整合情感建模提升了世界模型对社会行为的预测能力

Abstract: World Models serve as tools for understanding the current state of the world and predicting its future dynamics, with broad application potential across numerous fields. As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.

This technical report mainly presents the underlying training infrastructure that enables reliable and efficient scaling to frontier model sizes. We detail systematic methodologies for operator-level and end-to-end numerical accuracy verification, ensuring consistency across hardware platforms and distributed parallelism strategies. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of performance optimizations, including interleaved pipeline scheduling, attention-aware data scheduling for long-sequence training,hierarchical and overlapped communication for expert parallelism, and DVM-based operator fusion. A systematic parallelization framework, leveraging analytical estimation and integer linear programming, is also proposed to optimize multi-dimensional parallelism configurations. Additionally, we present methodological approaches to cluster-level optimizations, addressing host- and device-bound bottlenecks during large-scale training tasks. These infrastructure advancements yield significant throughput improvements and near-linear scaling on clusters comprising thousands of devices, providing a robust foundation for large-scale language model development on hardware ecosystems.

TL;DR: MedKGI是一个基于临床实践的诊断框架，通过整合医学知识图谱、基于信息增益选择问题和结构化状态跟踪，解决了LLM在临床诊断中的幻觉、冗余提问和对话一致性等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在临床诊断中存在三个关键限制：1）由于缺乏验证知识基础而产生医学内容幻觉；2）提出冗余或低效问题而非有助于诊断进展的区分性问题；3）在多轮对话中失去连贯性，导致矛盾或不一致的结论。需要模拟真实临床场景中迭代、假设驱动的诊断推理过程。

Method: 提出MedKGI诊断框架，包含三个核心组件：1）整合医学知识图谱，将推理约束在验证过的医学本体中；2）基于信息增益选择问题，最大化诊断效率；3）采用OSCE格式的结构化状态，在多轮对话中保持一致的证据跟踪。

Result: 在临床基准测试中，MedKGI在诊断准确性和询问效率方面均优于强大的LLM基线，平均提高对话效率30%，同时保持最先进的准确性。

Conclusion: MedKGI通过将临床实践原则整合到LLM驱动的诊断中，有效解决了当前模型在医学推理中的关键限制，为开发更可靠、高效的临床AI助手提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise in clinical diagnosis. However, current models struggle to emulate the iterative, diagnostic hypothesis-driven reasoning of real clinical scenarios. Specifically, current LLMs suffer from three critical limitations: (1) generating hallucinated medical content due to weak grounding in verified knowledge, (2) asking redundant or inefficient questions rather than discriminative ones that hinder diagnostic progress, and (3) losing coherence over multi-turn dialogues, leading to contradictory or inconsistent conclusions. To address these challenges, we propose MedKGI, a diagnostic framework grounded in clinical practices. MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph (KG) to constrain reasoning to validated medical ontologies, selects questions based on information gain to maximize diagnostic efficiency, and adopts an OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across turns. Experiments on clinical benchmarks show that MedKGI outperforms strong LLM baselines in both diagnostic accuracy and inquiry efficiency, improving dialogue efficiency by 30% on average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要开发一个能够同时处理专利和科学文献的语言相似性模型，以更好地理解和预测专利与学术论文之间的引用关系，并探索不同司法管辖区引用行为的差异。

Method: 基于SPECTER2模型进行专利领域的微调，创建Pat-SPECTER模型。通过马赛式评估比较八种语言相似性模型在预测可信专利-论文引用方面的性能，并在两种实际场景中验证模型能力。

Result: Pat-SPECTER模型在预测专利-论文引用方面表现最佳。验证了美国专利因诚信义务（duty of candor）要求，引用的论文与专利内容语义相似度低于其他主要司法管辖区。

Conclusion: Pat-SPECTER是处理专利和科学文献相似性的有效工具，揭示了不同司法管辖区引用行为的系统性差异，模型已开源供学术界和从业者使用。

Abstract: We develop a language similarity model suitable for working with patents and scientific publications at the same time. In a horse race-style evaluation, we subject eight language (similarity) models to predict credible Patent-Paper Citations. We find that our Pat-SPECTER model performs best, which is the SPECTER2 model fine-tuned on patents. In two real-world scenarios (separating patent-paper-pairs and predicting patent-paper-pairs) we demonstrate the capabilities of the Pat-SPECTER. We finally test the hypothesis that US patents cite papers that are semantically less similar than in other large jurisdictions, which we posit is because of the duty of candor. The model is open for the academic community and practitioners alike.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DATAMASK是一个用于大规模预训练数据选择的高效联合学习框架，能够同时优化质量和多样性指标，从15万亿token的FineWeb数据集中选择约10%的子集，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法存在局限性：基于质量指标的选择在长期预训练中收益递减，而基于多样性指标的选择会移除过多高质量样本，两者都限制了预训练大语言模型的能力。由于计算成本高，这些指标很少在万亿级token数据集上联合考虑。

Method: DATAMASK将数据选择过程视为掩码学习问题，通过迭代采样数据掩码、基于预定义目标计算策略梯度、更新掩码采样逻辑。采用基于策略梯度的优化和各种加速增强，相比贪心算法将选择时间减少98.9%。

Result: 从15万亿token的FineWeb数据集中选择约10%的子集（FineWeb-Mask），在12个多样化任务上评估，1.5B密集模型性能提升3.2%，7B MoE模型性能提升1.9%。

Conclusion: DATAMASK是一个高效的大规模预训练数据选择框架，能够同时优化质量和多样性指标，显著提升模型性能，为万亿级token数据集的数据选择提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.

TL;DR: FIGR通过强化学习将视觉思维整合到多轮推理中，构建视觉表示来外化中间结构假设，在复杂数学推理任务上显著优于纯文本方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂推理问题常涉及隐含的空间、几何和结构关系，这些关系在文本中未明确编码。纯文本推理难以表示复杂场景中的全局结构约束。

Method: FIGR通过端到端强化学习将主动视觉思维整合到多轮推理中，在问题解决过程中构建视觉表示来外化中间结构假设，并自适应地调节何时以及如何调用视觉推理。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试中，FIGR显著优于强大的纯文本思维链基线。具体来说，FIGR在AIME 2025上比基础模型提高了13.12%，在BeyondAIME上提高了11.00%。

Conclusion: 图形引导的多模态推理能有效增强复杂推理的稳定性和可靠性，视觉表示有助于捕捉纯文本难以处理的全局结构属性。

Abstract: Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models have achieved strong performance across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates active visual thinking into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines. In particular, FIGR improves the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME, highlighting the effectiveness of figure-guided multimodal reasoning in enhancing the stability and reliability of complex reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出基于人类略读策略的自监督对比学习框架，通过随机掩码文档段落并使用NLI对比目标来增强长文档表示，在法医和生物医学文本上取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在处理长文档（特别是法律和医学领域）时存在困难，稀疏注意力机制资源消耗大且难以捕获完整文档上下文，分层Transformer模型效率较好但无法清晰解释文档不同部分之间的关系。人类通过略读重要段落来理解整体信息的策略启发了本研究。

Method: 提出新的自监督对比学习框架：1）随机掩码文档的一个段落；2）使用基于自然语言推理（NLI）的对比目标，将被掩码段落与相关部分对齐，同时与不相关部分保持距离；3）模拟人类综合信息的方式，生成更丰富且计算效率更高的文档表示。

Result: 在法律和生物医学文本上的实验证实了该方法在准确性和效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类略读策略的自监督对比学习框架，能够有效增强长文档表示，在保持计算效率的同时提高表示质量，特别适用于法律和医学等需要处理长文档的专业领域。

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown strong performance in word- and sentence-level tasks, effectively representing long documents, especially in fields like law and medicine, remains difficult. Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 自动文本摘要在英语等高资源语言上已取得高性能，但对低资源语言的摘要研究相对较少。本研究旨在探索和比较低资源语言文本摘要的各种方法。

Method: 比较了多种方法：1）不同大小LLM的零样本提示；2）微调mT5模型（含三种数据增强方法和多语言迁移）；3）LLM翻译管道方法（源语言→英语→摘要→翻译回源语言）。使用五种不同指标进行评估。

Result: 1）相似参数规模的LLM性能存在差异；2）多语言微调的mT5基线在大多数指标上优于包括零样本LLM在内的大多数方法；3）LLM作为评估器在低资源语言上可能不够可靠。

Conclusion: 对于低资源语言文本摘要，微调多语言模型（如mT5）是有效的方法，而LLM的零样本性能和多语言评估可靠性需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages. This work compares a variety of different approaches to summarization from zero-shot prompting of LLMs large and small to fine-tuning smaller models like mT5 with and without three data augmentation approaches and multilingual transfer. We also explore an LLM translation pipeline approach, translating from the source language to English, summarizing and translating back. Evaluating with five different metrics, we find that there is variation across LLMs in their performance across similar parameter sizes, that our multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics, and that LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.

TL;DR: 开发了一个针对雅思写作考试的智能修订平台，通过设计研究法从规则系统升级到Transformer模型，实现了自动评分和个性化反馈，显著提升了考生成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的雅思写作备考方法缺乏个性化反馈，无法针对雅思写作评分标准提供定制化指导。需要开发一个能够提供自动化评分和针对性反馈的平台来弥补这些不足。

Method: 采用设计研究法进行迭代开发：早期使用规则系统，后期升级为DistilBERT Transformer模型加回归头进行评分。平台架构将对话指导与写作界面分离以减少认知负荷，模拟真实考试环境。

Result: 规则系统存在中段压缩、低准确性和负R²值等根本限制。DistilBERT模型显著改善，MAE为0.66，R²为正。自适应反馈使平均成绩提高0.060个等级（p=0.011，Cohen's d=0.504），但效果因修订策略而异。

Conclusion: 自动化反馈功能最适合作为人工教学的补充，保守的表面修正比激进的结构干预更可靠。高分段评估仍具挑战，未来需要与真实考生进行纵向研究并由官方考官验证。

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a proposed revision platform assisting candidates for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing exam. Traditional IELTS preparation methods lack personalised feedback, catered to the IELTS writing rubric. To address these shortcomings, the platform features an attractive user interface (UI), an Automated Essay Scoring system (AES), and targeted feedback tailored to candidates and the IELTS writing rubric. The platform architecture separates conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface to reduce cognitive load and simulate exam conditions. Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.
  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values. DBR Cycle 4 implemented a DistilBERT transformer model with a regression head, yielding substantial improvements with MAE of 0.66 and positive $R^2$. This enabled Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation, which demonstrated statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504), though effectiveness varied by revision strategy. Findings suggest automated feedback functions are most suited as a supplement to human instruction, with conservative surface-level corrections proving more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for IELTS preparation contexts. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays, and future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音转录通常产生无结构的单词流，降低了可读性和再利用性。当前语音处理领域缺乏专门的段落分割任务，而文本分割领域也缺少鲁棒且自然的基准数据集。

Method: 1) 创建TEDPara（人工标注的TED演讲）和YTSegPara（带合成标签的YouTube视频）作为首个语音段落分割基准；2) 提出约束解码方法，让大语言模型在保留原始转录的同时插入段落分隔符；3) 开发紧凑模型MiniSeg实现最先进精度，并通过分层扩展联合预测章节和段落。

Result: 建立了首个语音段落分割基准数据集，提出的约束解码方法实现了忠实、句子对齐的评估，MiniSeg模型在保持高效计算的同时达到了最先进的准确率，分层扩展能同时预测章节和段落。

Conclusion: 该研究的资源和方将段落分割确立为语音处理中标准化、实用的任务，填补了语音处理与文本分割交叉领域的三个关键空白。

Abstract: Automatic speech transcripts are often delivered as unstructured word streams that impede readability and repurposing. We recast paragraph segmentation as the missing structuring step and fill three gaps at the intersection of speech processing and text segmentation. First, we establish TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels) as the first benchmarks for the paragraph segmentation task. The benchmarks focus on the underexplored speech domain, where paragraph segmentation has traditionally not been part of post-processing, while also contributing to the wider text segmentation field, which still lacks robust and naturalistic benchmarks. Second, we propose a constrained-decoding formulation that lets large language models insert paragraph breaks while preserving the original transcript, enabling faithful, sentence-aligned evaluation. Third, we show that a compact model (MiniSeg) attains state-of-the-art accuracy and, when extended hierarchically, jointly predicts chapters and paragraphs with minimal computational cost. Together, our resources and methods establish paragraph segmentation as a standardized, practical task in speech processing.

TL;DR: HaluNet是一个轻量级可训练的神经框架，通过集成多粒度令牌级不确定性来检测LLM幻觉，结合语义嵌入与概率置信度和分布不确定性，实现高效的单次幻觉检测。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在问答任务中表现出色，但经常产生幻觉（包括事实错误或捏造内容）。现有方法通常只关注单一类型的不确定性，而忽略了不同来源之间的互补性，特别是令牌级概率不确定性和内部语义表示传达的不确定性之间的互补关系。

Method: 提出HaluNet框架，集成多粒度令牌级不确定性，结合语义嵌入与概率置信度和分布不确定性。采用多分支架构自适应地融合模型已知信息与其输出中表达的不确定性，实现高效的单次幻觉检测。

Result: 在SQuAD、TriviaQA和Natural Questions数据集上的实验表明，HaluNet提供了强大的检测性能和良好的计算效率，无论是否访问上下文，突显了其在基于LLM的问答系统中实时幻觉检测的潜力。

Conclusion: HaluNet通过集成多粒度不确定性信号，提供了一种轻量级、可扩展的幻觉检测方法，能够有效捕捉LLM输出中的可靠性信号，为实时幻觉检测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at question answering (QA) but often generate hallucinations, including factual errors or fabricated content. Detecting hallucinations from internal uncertainty signals is attractive due to its scalability and independence from external resources. Existing methods often aim to accurately capture a single type of uncertainty while overlooking the complementarity among different sources, particularly between token-level probability uncertainty and the uncertainty conveyed by internal semantic representations, which provide complementary views on model reliability. We present \textbf{HaluNet}, a lightweight and trainable neural framework that integrates multi granular token level uncertainties by combining semantic embeddings with probabilistic confidence and distributional uncertainty. Its multi branch architecture adaptively fuses what the model knows with the uncertainty expressed in its outputs, enabling efficient one pass hallucination detection. Experiments on SQuAD, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions show that HaluNet delivers strong detection performance and favorable computational efficiency, with or without access to context, highlighting its potential for real time hallucination detection in LLM based QA systems.

TL;DR: KCL是一个评估语言模型法律推理能力的基准，通过提供问题级别的支持判例来分离推理能力与领域知识，包含选择题和开放式问题两部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律基准往往混淆了语言模型的推理能力和参数化知识，需要开发能够独立评估法律推理能力的基准。

Method: 构建KCL基准，包含KCL-MCQA（283个选择题，1103个对齐判例）和KCL-Essay（169个开放式问题，550个对齐判例，2739个实例级评分标准），提供问题级别的支持判例来分离推理与知识。

Result: 对30多个模型的系统评估显示存在较大差距，特别是在KCL-Essay部分，专门用于推理的模型始终优于通用模型。

Conclusion: KCL基准能够有效评估语言模型的法律推理能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并表明推理专门化模型具有优势，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: We introduce the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL), a benchmark designed to assess language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of domain-specific knowledge. KCL provides question-level supporting precedents, enabling a more faithful disentanglement of reasoning ability from parameterized knowledge. KCL consists of two components: (1) KCL-MCQA, multiple-choice problems of 283 questions with 1,103 aligned precedents, and (2) KCL-Essay, open-ended generation problems of 169 questions with 550 aligned precedents and 2,739 instance-level rubrics for automated evaluation. Our systematic evaluation of 30+ models shows large remaining gaps, particularly in KCL-Essay, and that reasoning-specialized models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts. We release all resources, including the benchmark dataset and evaluation code, at https://github.com/lbox-kr/kcl.

TL;DR: CREST是一种无需训练的方法，通过识别和干预LLM中的认知注意力头来优化推理过程，提高准确率同时减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型依赖长链式思维推理解决复杂任务，但这种方法效率低下，导致高延迟和不稳定推理（思维不足或过度思考）。

Method: CREST包含两个组件：1）离线校准步骤识别认知注意力头并推导头特定的引导向量；2）推理时程序通过旋转隐藏表示来抑制这些向量方向上的成分。

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试和模型中，CREST将准确率提升高达17.5%，同时减少37.6%的token使用量。

Conclusion: CREST提供了一种简单有效的途径，实现更快、更可靠的大型语言模型推理，通过自适应抑制非生产性推理行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: Youtu-LLM是一个1.96B参数的轻量级语言模型，通过从头预训练而非蒸馏方法，在保持高计算效率的同时具备原生智能体能力，支持128k上下文窗口，在STEM和智能体任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个轻量级但功能强大的语言模型，能够在保持计算效率的同时具备原生智能体智能，解决典型小模型依赖蒸馏方法而缺乏深度推理和规划能力的问题。

Method: 1. 采用密集多潜在注意力（MLA）架构和STEM导向词汇表，支持128k上下文窗口；2. 使用"常识-STEM-智能体"课程学习策略，通过约11T token的多阶段训练；3. 针对智能体任务采用可扩展的中期训练，通过多样化数据构建方案合成数学、编码和工具使用领域的轨迹。

Result: Youtu-LLM在2B以下模型中达到新的最先进水平，在通用基准测试中与更大模型竞争，在智能体特定任务上显著超越现有SOTA基线，证明轻量级模型可以具备强大的内在智能体能力。

Conclusion: Youtu-LLM展示了通过系统化从头预训练和精心设计的课程学习，轻量级语言模型可以在保持计算效率的同时获得深度认知能力和原生智能体智能，为资源受限环境下的智能体应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled "Commonsense-STEM-Agent" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.

*Casey O. Barkan,Sid Black,Oliver Sourbut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs普遍过度自信，但大多数能比随机更好地预测任务成功率。随着多步骤任务推进，前沿LLMs的过度自信加剧。在失败经验背景下，部分LLMs能减少过度自信并改善决策，但所有LLMs的决策都基于其过度乐观的成功概率估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能预测自己在任务中的成功率，以及这种预测能力是否会随着多步骤任务的进展而改善。同时探索LLMs能否从上下文经验中学习，在失败成本高的场景中做出更好的任务选择决策。

Method: 测试多种LLMs预测任务成功率的能力，评估其在多步骤任务中的预测变化，研究在失败经验背景下LLMs的决策改进情况。比较不同模型（包括推理型和非推理型LLMs）的表现差异。

Result: 所有测试的LLMs都表现出过度自信，但大多数具有优于随机的判别能力。新近和更大的LLMs通常没有更强的判别能力（Claude模型除外）。在多步骤任务中，前沿LLMs的过度自信随任务进展加剧。在失败经验背景下，部分LLMs能减少过度自信并显著改善决策，但所有LLMs的决策都基于其过度乐观的成功概率估计。

Conclusion: 当前LLM智能体缺乏对自身能力的认知，这限制了其表现。LLMs对自身能力的认知不足会影响AI的误用和错位风险，需要进一步研究LLMs的能力意识问题。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.

TL;DR: R-Debater是一个基于论证记忆的智能辩论框架，通过检索历史论据和辩论策略来生成多轮连贯辩论，在单轮和多轮辩论任务中均优于现有LLM基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辩论系统缺乏跨轮次的立场一致性和证据支持能力，需要一种能够记忆并适应先前论据的框架来生成更连贯、立场一致的辩论。

Method: 基于修辞学和记忆研究，构建包含辩论知识库（检索案例证据和历史辩论策略）和基于角色的智能体系统，通过检索和结构化规划生成连贯的多轮辩论话语。

Result: 在ORCHID标准辩论数据集上评估，R-Debater在单轮话语生成（InspireScore）和多轮对抗模拟（Debatrix）中均获得更高分数，人类评估也证实其具有更好的立场一致性和证据使用能力。

Conclusion: 将检索基础与结构化规划相结合能够生成更忠实、立场对齐且跨轮次连贯的辩论，论证记忆机制显著提升了辩论系统的性能。

Abstract: We present R-Debater, an agentic framework for generating multi-turn debates built on argumentative memory. Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.

TL;DR: 本文提出MUSIC方法，通过多轮对话对比数据增强训练多轮奖励模型，在保持单轮评估性能的同时显著提升多轮对话质量评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多轮对话质量对开发大型语言模型至关重要，但现有方法依赖昂贵的人工评估。传统偏好数据集通常只基于最终轮次进行对比，无法捕捉多轮交互的细微差别，需要更有效的多轮评估方法。

Method: 提出MUSIC（多步指令对比）无监督数据增强策略，通过合成跨多个轮次存在差异的对比对话对。基于Skywork偏好数据集，在Gemma-2-9B-Instruct模型上训练多轮奖励模型。

Result: MUSIC增强的奖励模型在基准方法中表现最佳，与先进专有LLM评估者的判断更一致，且不损害标准单轮奖励模型的性能。

Conclusion: 多轮对比对于构建鲁棒的多轮奖励模型至关重要，MUSIC方法能有效提升多轮对话质量评估能力，为LLM训练提供有价值的指导信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn conversations is crucial for developing capable Large Language Models (LLMs), yet remains a significant challenge, often requiring costly human evaluation. Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \textit{training} techniques, effective automated \textit{evaluation} specifically for multi-turn interactions lags behind. We observe that standard preference datasets, typically contrasting responses based only on the final conversational turn, provide insufficient signal to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions. Instead, we find that incorporating contrasts spanning \textit{multiple} turns is critical for building robust multi-turn RMs. Motivated by this finding, we propose \textbf{MU}lti-\textbf{S}tep \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{C}ontrast (MUSIC), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs exhibiting differences across multiple turns. Leveraging MUSIC on the Skywork preference dataset, we train a multi-turn RM based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. Empirical results demonstrate that our MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, crucially, without compromising performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.

TL;DR: BIOME-Bench：首个用于评估大语言模型在多组学分析中生物分子交互推理和通路机制解析能力的标准化基准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多组学研究依赖通路富集分析，但存在通路资源的结构性限制（如更新滞后、功能冗余、对分子状态和干预的敏感性有限）。虽然已有研究探索使用大语言模型改进通路富集分析，但缺乏标准化的端到端多组学通路机制解析基准，限制了可重复性进展。

Method: 通过严格的四阶段工作流程构建BIOME-Bench基准，评估大语言模型在多组学分析中的两个核心能力：1）生物分子交互推理；2）端到端多组学通路机制解析。为这两个任务开发评估协议，并在多个当代强模型上进行综合实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有模型在多组学分析中仍存在显著缺陷：难以可靠地区分细粒度的生物分子关系类型，也无法生成忠实、稳健的通路级机制解释。

Conclusion: BIOME-Bench为评估大语言模型在多组学分析中的能力提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前模型在生物分子交互推理和通路机制解析方面的局限性，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Multi-omics studies often rely on pathway enrichment to interpret heterogeneous molecular changes, but pathway enrichment (PE)-based workflows inherit structural limitations of pathway resources, including curation lag, functional redundancy, and limited sensitivity to molecular states and interventions. Although recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to improve PE-based interpretation, the lack of a standardized benchmark for end-to-end multi-omics pathway mechanism elucidation has largely confined evaluation to small, manually curated datasets or ad hoc case studies, hindering reproducible progress. To address this issue, we introduce BIOME-Bench, constructed via a rigorous four-stage workflow, to evaluate two core capabilities of LLMs in multi-omics analysis: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation. We develop evaluation protocols for both tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple strong contemporary models. Experimental results demonstrate that existing models still exhibit substantial deficiencies in multi-omics analysis, struggling to reliably distinguish fine-grained biomolecular relation types and to generate faithful, robust pathway-level mechanistic explanations.

Motivation: 当前研究往往忽视长推理序列生成带来的显著计算负担。工业应用中的模型选择不仅取决于原始准确率，还受到资源约束和推理成本的影响。需要评估不同模型在计算效率与性能之间的权衡。

Method: 对当代和早期开源LLMs进行测试时计算感知评估，在数学和推理密集型基准测试中绘制其帕累托前沿。分析专家混合架构的效率优势，追踪帕累托效率随时间的变化趋势，并识别推理计算的饱和点。

Result: 专家混合架构在评估环境中表现出性能与效率的最佳平衡。发现了准确率提升与计算单位之间的涌现趋势。识别出推理计算存在饱和点，超过特定阈值后准确率增益会递减，表明扩展推理能力无法克服模型固有的复杂性限制。

Conclusion: 模型选择需要综合考虑性能与计算效率。专家混合架构是实现这种平衡的有前景方案。推理计算存在收益递减点，这表明单纯增加推理步骤无法解决模型固有的能力限制，为工业部署提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are demonstrating rapid improvements on complex reasoning benchmarks, particularly when allowed to utilize intermediate reasoning steps before converging on a final solution. However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.

We introduce our course on Ethical Aspects in NLP and our pedagogical approach, grounded in active learning through interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and "learning by teaching" methods. Over four years, the course has been refined and adapted across different institutions, educational levels, and interdisciplinary backgrounds; it has also yielded many reusable products, both in the form of teaching materials and in the form of actual educational products aimed at diverse audiences, made by the students themselves. By sharing our approach and experience, we hope to provide inspiration for educators seeking to incorporate social impact considerations into their curricula.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言模型在整体表现上很强，但在不同语言、文字和文化中的行为不可预测。现有机制解释缺乏因果标准，无法区分真正的机制和虚假的相关性。

Method: 提出三角验证方法：1) 定义参考族作为保持谓词意义的变体；2) 要求电路满足必要性（消融会降低目标行为）、充分性（补丁激活能转移行为）和不变性（在参考族中效果保持稳定）；3) 使用自动电路发现提供候选子图，通过三角验证接受或拒绝；4) 将三角验证与因果抽象理论连接，作为分布互换干预的近似变换分数。

Result: 三角验证为机制主张提供了可证伪的标准，能够过滤那些通过单环境测试但在跨语言不变性上失败的虚假电路。该方法通过比较实验协议在多模型家族、语言对和任务中得到验证。

Conclusion: 三角验证为多语言模型的机制解释建立了严格的因果标准，确保解释在不同语言环境中保持稳定，提高了机制发现的可信度和实用性。

Abstract: Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.

TL;DR: Encyclo-K是一个基于知识陈述而非问题的基准测试框架，通过从权威教科书中提取独立知识陈述，在测试时动态组合成评估问题，解决了现有基准测试的三个主要限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要基于问题层面构建，存在三个根本限制：1) 容易受到数据污染影响；2) 仅限于单知识点评估；3) 依赖昂贵的领域专家标注。需要一种新的基准测试方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 从权威教科书中提取独立的知识陈述作为基本单元，在测试时通过随机抽样动态组合这些陈述生成评估问题。每个问题聚合8-10个陈述，标注者只需验证格式合规性而不需要领域专业知识。

Result: 在50多个大语言模型上的实验显示，Encyclo-K具有强大的区分能力。即使是表现最好的OpenAI-GPT-5.1也仅达到62.07%的准确率。推理模型准确率在16.04%到62.07%之间，聊天模型在9.71%到50.40%之间，显示出清晰的梯度分布。

Conclusion: Encyclo-K成功解决了现有基准测试的三个限制，验证了动态评估和多陈述综合理解带来的挑战，为评估大语言模型对多个细粒度学科知识陈述的综合理解提供了一个可扩展的动态评估框架。

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.

Motivation: 超连接(HC)虽然提升了性能，但破坏了残差连接的恒等映射特性，导致训练不稳定、可扩展性受限和内存访问开销增加

Method: 提出流形约束超连接(mHC)框架，将HC的残差连接空间投影到特定流形以恢复恒等映射特性，并进行严格的基础设施优化确保效率

Result: mHC在规模化训练中有效，提供实质性性能改进和优越的可扩展性

Conclusion: mHC作为HC的灵活实用扩展，有助于深入理解拓扑架构设计，为基础模型的演进提供有前景的方向

Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.

TL;DR: ADOPT是一个用于多步LLM管道的自适应依赖感知提示优化框架，通过建模步骤间依赖关系和文本梯度估计来优化多步提示，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步LLM管道能有效解决复杂任务，但其性能严重依赖每一步的提示。联合优化这些提示很困难，因为缺乏步骤级监督和步骤间依赖关系。现有的端到端提示优化方法在这些条件下表现不佳，往往产生次优或不稳定的更新。

Method: ADOPT框架明确建模每个LLM步骤与最终任务结果之间的依赖关系，实现类似计算解析导数的精确文本梯度估计。它将文本梯度估计与梯度更新解耦，将多提示优化简化为灵活的单提示优化步骤，并采用基于Shapley值的机制自适应分配优化资源。

Result: 在真实世界数据集和多样化管道结构上的实验表明，ADOPT是有效且鲁棒的，在性能上始终优于最先进的提示优化基线方法。

Conclusion: ADOPT框架成功解决了多步LLM管道中的提示优化挑战，通过依赖感知的梯度估计和自适应资源分配机制，实现了稳定且高效的提示优化，为复杂LLM应用提供了实用的优化解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.

### [130] [Modeling Language as a Sequence of Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25026)
*Nasim Borazjanizadeh,James McClelland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Thought Gestalt模型，通过双层抽象（token和句子级"思想"状态）改进Transformer语言模型，使其能形成全局一致的实体和事件表示，提高数据效率和关系方向泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer语言模型主要依赖表层共现统计，无法形成全局一致的潜在实体和事件表示，导致关系方向脆弱性（如逆转诅咒）、上下文错误和数据效率低下。受认知科学启发，人类理解语言时会将其转换为紧凑的事件式表示并持久化在记忆中。

Method: 提出Thought Gestalt模型，一种循环Transformer，在token和句子级"思想"状态两个抽象层次上建模语言。模型逐句生成token，同时交叉关注先前句子表示的记忆。使用相同参数集生成token和句子表示，通过单一目标（下一个token交叉熵）训练，保留写入记忆的句子表示计算图，使未来token损失的梯度通过交叉注意力反向传播优化早期句子向量生成参数。

Result: 在扩展实验中，TG相比匹配的GPT-2运行始终提高效率，扩展拟合表明GPT-2需要约5-8%更多数据和33-42%更多参数才能匹配TG的损失。TG在父子逆转诅咒探针上减少了关系方向泛化错误。

Conclusion: Thought Gestalt模型通过引入句子级抽象表示，使语言模型能够形成更全局一致的潜在表示，提高数据效率和关系方向泛化能力，为改进Transformer架构提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.

*Chao Peng,Bin Wang,Zhilei Long,Jinfang Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaGReS是一个用于检索增强生成(RAG)的冗余感知上下文选择框架，通过结合查询-文档相关性和集合内冗余惩罚的集合级目标函数，在token预算约束下进行贪婪选择，无需手动调参即可优化上下文质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准top-k检索在RAG中经常返回冗余或近似重复的文档块，这会浪费token预算并降低下游生成质量。现有方法缺乏对冗余的系统性控制，且需要手动调整相关性与冗余之间的权衡参数。

Method: 提出AdaGReS框架：1) 定义结合查询-文档相关性和集合内冗余惩罚的集合级目标函数；2) 在token预算约束下使用基于边际增益的贪婪选择；3) 引入闭式实例自适应校准机制，自动调整相关性与冗余的权衡参数，无需手动调参；4) 提供理论分析证明目标函数在实践条件下具有ε-近似子模性。

Result: 在开放域问答(Natural Questions)和高冗余生物医学(药物)语料库上的实验表明，AdaGReS在冗余控制和上下文质量方面持续改进，转化为更好的端到端答案质量和跨设置的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGReS通过系统性地结合冗余感知选择和自适应参数校准，有效解决了RAG中的冗余问题，提高了上下文选择质量，从而改善了生成性能，同时提供了理论保证和实际有效性验证。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.

TL;DR: 提出AgenticTCAD框架，通过自然语言驱动的多智能体系统实现端到端自动化器件设计与优化，显著提升2纳米纳米片FET设计效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着先进工艺节点的持续微缩，设计-技术协同优化变得日益关键，但TCAD仿真领域缺乏开源资源，阻碍了语言模型生成有效TCAD代码的能力

Method: 构建专家策划的开源TCAD数据集，微调领域特定模型用于TCAD代码生成，并在此基础上提出AgenticTCAD——一个自然语言驱动的多智能体框架

Result: 在2纳米纳米片FET设计验证中，AgenticTCAD在4.2小时内达到IRDS-2024器件规格，而人类专家使用商业工具需要7.1天

Conclusion: AgenticTCAD框架通过自动化器件设计与优化，显著提升了设计效率，为先进工艺节点下的TCAD仿真提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: With the continued scaling of advanced technology nodes, the design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) paradigm has become increasingly critical, rendering efficient device design and optimization essential. In the domain of TCAD simulation, however, the scarcity of open-source resources hinders language models from generating valid TCAD code. To overcome this limitation, we construct an open-source TCAD dataset curated by experts and fine-tune a domain-specific model for TCAD code generation. Building on this foundation, we propose AgenticTCAD, a natural language - driven multi-agent framework that enables end-to-end automated device design and optimization. Validation on a 2 nm nanosheet FET (NS-FET) design shows that AgenticTCAD achieves the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS)-2024 device specifications within 4.2 hours, whereas human experts required 7.1 days with commercial tools.

TL;DR: Hybrid-Code是一个混合神经符号多智能体框架，用于本地临床编码，通过冗余和验证确保生产可靠性，解决了云LLM的隐私和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于云的LLM进行临床编码存在隐私风险和延迟瓶颈，不适合本地医疗部署，需要一种既能保证可靠性又能保护隐私的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合神经符号多智能体框架：1) Coder智能体使用BioMistral-7B进行语义推理，不可靠时回退到确定性关键词匹配；2) Auditor智能体根据257个代码知识库和临床证据验证代码。

Result: 在1000份MIMIC-III出院摘要上评估：知识库内接受输出无幻觉代码，验证率24.47%，覆盖率34.11%(95% CI: 31.2%-37.0%)，语言模型利用率86%+，Auditor拒绝率75.53%，确保患者数据不离开医院防火墙。

Conclusion: 混合架构结合语言模型语义理解、确定性回退和符号验证，确保了可靠性和隐私保护。在医疗生产系统中，通过冗余实现的可靠性比纯模型性能更有价值。

Abstract: Clinical coding automation using cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) poses privacy risks and latency bottlenecks, rendering them unsuitable for on-premise healthcare deployment. We introduce Hybrid-Code, a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for local clinical coding that ensures production reliability through redundancy and verification. Our system comprises two agents: a Coder that attempts language model-based semantic reasoning using BioMistral-7B but falls back to deterministic keyword matching when model output is unreliable, ensuring pipeline completion; and an Auditor that verifies codes against a 257-code knowledge base and clinical evidence. Evaluating on 1,000 MIMIC-III discharge summaries, we demonstrate no hallucinated codes among accepted outputs within the knowledge base, 24.47% verification rate, and 34.11% coverage (95% CI: 31.2%--37.0%) with 86%+ language model utilization. The Auditor filtered invalid format codes and provided evidence-based quality control (75.53% rejection rate) while ensuring no patient data leaves the hospital firewall. The hybrid architecture -- combining language model semantic understanding (when successful), deterministic fallback (when the model fails), and symbolic verification (always active) -- ensures both reliability and privacy preservation, addressing critical barriers to AI adoption in healthcare. Our key finding is that reliability through redundancy is more valuable than pure model performance in production healthcare systems, where system failures are unacceptable.

TL;DR: DEFT：一种基于连续优化的可微分ATPG方法，通过数学重构将离散ATPG问题转化为连续优化任务，显著提升难检测故障的覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代IC复杂性导致测试模式数量激增，其中大部分模式针对少数难检测故障，需要新的ATPG算法来提高对这类故障的测试效果。

Method: 提出DEFT方法，将离散ATPG问题重新表述为连续优化任务，引入数学基础的重参数化使连续目标与离散故障检测语义对齐，支持可靠的基于梯度的模式生成。为处理深度电路图，集成定制CUDA内核进行高效前向-反向传播，并应用梯度归一化缓解梯度消失问题。

Result: 在两个工业基准测试中，与领先的商业工具相比，在相同模式预算和可比运行时间下，DEFT将难检测故障检测率平均提高了21.1%和48.9%。在部分赋值模式生成等实际ATPG设置中，DEFT生成的模式减少了19.3%的0/1比特，同时仍能检测到35%更多的故障。

Conclusion: DEFT是一种有前景且有效的ATPG引擎，为现有启发式方法提供了有价值的补充，通过可微分优化框架显著提升了难检测故障的测试效果。

Abstract: Modern IC complexity drives test pattern growth, with the majority of patterns targeting a small set of hard-to-detect (HTD) faults. This motivates new ATPG algorithms to improve test effectiveness specifically for HTD faults. This paper presents DEFT (Differentiable Automatic Test Pattern Generation), a new ATPG approach that reformulates the discrete ATPG problem as a continuous optimization task. DEFT introduces a mathematically grounded reparameterization that aligns the expected continuous objective with discrete fault-detection semantics, enabling reliable gradient-based pattern generation. To ensure scalability and stability on deep circuit graphs, DEFT integrates a custom CUDA kernel for efficient forward-backward propagation and applies gradient normalization to mitigate vanishing gradients. Compared to a leading commercial tool on two industrial benchmarks, DEFT improves HTD fault detection by 21.1% and 48.9% on average under the same pattern budget and comparable runtime. DEFT also supports practical ATPG settings such as partial assignment pattern generation, producing patterns with 19.3% fewer 0/1 bits while still detecting 35% more faults. These results indicate DEFT is a promising and effective ATPG engine, offering a valuable complement to existing heuristic.

Abstract: We present Mify-Coder, a 2.5B-parameter code model trained on 4.2T tokens using a compute-optimal strategy built on the Mify-2.5B foundation model. Mify-Coder achieves comparable accuracy and safety while significantly outperforming much larger baseline models on standard coding and function-calling benchmarks, demonstrating that compact models can match frontier-grade models in code generation and agent-driven workflows. Our training pipeline combines high-quality curated sources with synthetic data generated through agentically designed prompts, refined iteratively using enterprise-grade evaluation datasets. LLM-based quality filtering further enhances data density, enabling frugal yet effective training. Through disciplined exploration of CPT-SFT objectives, data mixtures, and sampling dynamics, we deliver frontier-grade code intelligence within a single continuous training trajectory. Empirical evidence shows that principled data and compute discipline allow smaller models to achieve competitive accuracy, efficiency, and safety compliance. Quantized variants of Mify-Coder enable deployment on standard desktop environments without requiring specialized hardware.

Abstract: Context: Fairness in systems has emerged as a critical concern in software engineering, garnering increasing attention as the field has advanced in recent years. While several guidelines have been proposed to address fairness, achieving a comprehensive understanding of research solutions for ensuring fairness in software systems remains challenging. Objectives: This paper presents a systematic literature mapping to explore and categorize current advancements in fairness solutions within software engineering, focusing on three key dimensions: research trends, research focus, and viability in industrial contexts. Methods: We develop a classification framework to organize research on software fairness from a fresh perspective, applying it to 95 selected studies and analyzing their potential for industrial adoption. Results: Our findings reveal that software fairness research is expanding, yet it remains heavily focused on methods and algorithms. It primarily focuses on post-processing and group fairness, with less emphasis on early-stage interventions, individual fairness metrics, and understanding bias root causes. Additionally fairness research remains largely academic, with limited industry collaboration and low to medium Technology Readiness Level (TRL), indicating that industrial transferability remains distant. Conclusion: Our results underscore the need to incorporate fairness considerations across all stages of the software development life-cycle and to foster greater collaboration between academia and industry. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the field, offering a foundation to guide future research and practical applications of fairness in software systems.

TL;DR: 传统文件级软件缺陷预测存在准确率幻觉问题，因为标准评估奖励标签持久性偏差而非代码变更推理。本文提出将SDP重新定义为变更感知预测任务，并开发了基于LLM的多智能体辩论框架，显著提高了对缺陷引入的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文件级软件缺陷预测报告的性能提升很大程度上是准确率幻觉。传统方法依赖静态文件快照，而大多数文件在多个版本中持续存在并保留缺陷标签，标准评估奖励的是标签持久性偏差而非对代码变更的推理能力。

Method: 将SDP重新定义为变更感知预测任务，模型在连续项目版本中推理文件的代码变更而非依赖静态快照。提出基于LLM的变更感知多智能体辩论框架，通过智能体间的辩论来增强对代码变更的理解和缺陷预测。

Result: 在多个PROMISE项目上的实验显示：传统模型获得虚高的F1分数，但在罕见但关键的缺陷转换案例上失败；而变更感知推理和多智能体辩论框架在演化子集上表现更均衡，显著提高了对缺陷引入的敏感性。

Conclusion: 当前SDP评估实践存在根本缺陷，强调在实际缺陷预测中需要变更感知推理。提出的变更感知多智能体辩论框架为解决标签持久性偏差问题提供了有效方案，为软件缺陷预测开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Much of the reported progress in file-level software defect prediction (SDP) is, in reality, nothing but an illusion of accuracy. Over the last decades, machine learning and deep learning models have reported increasing performance across software versions. However, since most files persist across releases and retain their defect labels, standard evaluation rewards label-persistence bias rather than reasoning about code changes. To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware prediction task, in which models reason over code changes of a file within successive project versions, rather than relying on static file snapshots. Building on this formulation, we propose an LLM-driven, change-aware, multi-agent debate framework. Our experiments on multiple PROMISE projects show that traditional models achieve inflated F1, while failing on rare but critical defect-transition cases. In contrast, our change-aware reasoning and multi-agent debate framework yields more balanced performance across evolution subsets and significantly improves sensitivity to defect introductions. These results highlight fundamental flaws in current SDP evaluation practices and emphasize the need for change-aware reasoning in practical defect prediction. The source code is publicly available.

Prior research has primarily examined AI-based coding at the individual level or in educational settings, leaving industrial practitioners' perspectives underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how LLM coding tools are used in professional practice, the associated concerns and risks, and the resulting transformations in development workflows, with particular attention to implications for computing education. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 57 curated YouTube videos published between late 2024 and 2025, capturing reflections and experiences shared by practitioners. Following a filtering and quality assessment process, the selected sources were analyzed to compare LLM-based and traditional programming, identify emerging risks, and characterize evolving workflows. Our findings reveal definitions of AI-based coding practices, notable productivity gains, and lowered barriers to entry. Practitioners also report a shift in development bottlenecks toward code review and concerns regarding code quality, maintainability, security vulnerabilities, ethical issues, erosion of foundational problem-solving skills, and insufficient preparation of entry-level engineers. Building on these insights, we discuss implications for computer science and software engineering education and argue for curricular shifts toward problem-solving, architectural thinking, code review, and early project-based learning that integrates LLM tools. This study offers an industry-grounded perspective on AI-based coding and provides guidance for aligning educational practices with rapidly evolving professional realities.

TL;DR: 使用AI助手开发了一种基于包含逻辑属性的形式化规范模式来系统构建受控自然语言需求的方法，该方法包括三个阶段：编译通用自然语言需求模式、使用AI生成语料库、以及基于语法结构分析形式化受控自然语言语法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种系统化的方法来构建受控自然语言，以便更好地将形式化规范模式转化为自然语言需求，提高需求工程的质量和一致性。

Method: 方法包含三个阶段：1) 编译使用形式化规范模板所有属性的通用自然语言需求模式；2) 使用AI助手生成自然语言需求模式语料库，通过部分评估属性来减少模式；3) 基于结果模式的语法结构分析，形式化受控自然语言的语法。

Result: 该方法已针对事件驱动的时序需求进行了测试，能够系统地从形式化规范模式生成受控自然语言需求。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效构建受控自然语言，将形式化规范模式转化为结构化、一致的自然语言需求，特别适用于事件驱动的时序需求场景。

Abstract: Using an AI assistant, we developed a method for systematically constructing controlled natural language for requirements based on formal specification patterns containing logical attributes. The method involves three stages: 1) compiling a generalized natural language requirement pattern that utilizes all attributes of the formal specification template; 2) generating, using the AI assistant, a corpus of natural language requirement patterns, reduced by partially evaluating attributes (the developed prompt utilizes the generalized template, attribute definitions, and specific formal semantics of the requirement patterns); and 3) formalizing the syntax of the controlled natural language based on an analysis of the grammatical structure of the resulting patterns. The method has been tested for event-driven temporal requirements.

Abstract: The software development workplace poses numerous technical and collaborative accessibility challenges for blind and low vision software professionals (BLVSPs). Though Generative AI (GenAI) is increasingly adopted within the software development industry and has been a rapidly growing topic of interest in research, to date, the unique perspectives of BLVSPs have yet to be consulted. We report on a qualitative study involving 39 semi-structured interviews with BLVSPs about what the introduction of GenAI has meant for their work. We found that BLVSPs used GenAI for many software development tasks, resulting in benefits such as increased productivity and accessibility. However, significant costs were also accompanied by GenAI use as they were more vulnerable to hallucinations than their sighted colleagues. Sometimes, organizational policies prevented use. Based on our findings, we discuss the higher-risks and higher-returns that BLVSPs had to carefully weigh when deciding whether and when to use GenAI tools for work.

TL;DR: Unifico是一个多ISA编译器，通过保持跨架构的相同栈布局来消除异构ISA处理器中的运行时栈转换开销，将二进制大小开销从约200%降低到约10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构ISA处理器设计需要软件支持来桥接ISA异构性，但缺乏支持异构ISA目标的编译工具链阻碍了该领域研究。特别是运行时程序栈在不同架构间的转换成本过高。

Method: 设计开发Unifico编译器，使用LLVM基础设施，生成在x86-64和ARMv8 ISA上执行时保持相同栈布局的二进制文件，避免运行时栈转换，维护统一的ABI和虚拟地址空间。

Result: 在NAS基准测试中，Unifico对整体执行时间影响最小，高端处理器平均引入小于6%的开销，低端处理器小于10%。相比最先进的Popcorn编译器，二进制大小开销从约200%降低到约10%，同时消除了ISA迁移时的栈转换开销。

Conclusion: Unifico通过消除运行时栈转换开销，显著降低了异构ISA处理器的软件支持成本，其设计特性可以进一步优化以减轻性能影响，为异构ISA处理器研究提供了实用的编译工具链支持。

Abstract: Heterogeneous-ISA processor designs have attracted considerable research interest. However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, "getting right" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.

*David Gros,Prem Devanbu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种定位LLM生成代码中与用户意图不符部分的方法，通过创建"最小意图对齐补丁"数据集，比较了白盒探测与黑盒反射/自一致性方法，发现小监督模型能有效预测大模型生成代码的编辑位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM能够从自然语言提示生成复杂源代码，但生成的输出可能偏离用户意图，需要监督和编辑。为了支持这一过程，需要技术来定位生成代码中可能不符合用户意图的部分。

Method: 首先创建"最小意图对齐补丁"数据集，包含修复后的LLM生成程序，每个程序都使用测试用例验证正确性。然后比较多种技术：1）白盒探测（提出高效任意跨度查询技术）；2）黑盒反射方法；3）自一致性方法。测量这些技术为代码部分分配校准概率的能力，以指示哪些部分将在最小补丁中被编辑。

Result: 研究发现，使用小型监督模型的探测方法能够实现较低的校准误差，Brier技能得分约为0.2，能够有效估计由大几个数量级模型生成的代码中的编辑行。仅在代码上训练的探测模型在允许新概率缩放的情况下，显示出一定程度的泛化到自然语言错误的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了小监督模型能够有效定位大语言模型生成代码中的意图偏差，为AI监督和控制提供了技术基础，并探讨了这些技术的泛化能力和与AI监督控制的关系。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) can generate complicated source code from natural language prompts. However, LLMs can generate output that deviates from what the user wants, requiring supervision and editing. To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of "Minimal Intent Aligning Patches" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed.

TL;DR: 该研究首次对五种广泛使用的训练数据优化技术及其组合在LLM代码生成中的效果进行了大规模实证评估，发现数据合成在功能正确性方面最有效，而数据合成与数据重构的组合能获得最佳整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有许多训练数据优化技术被提出以提升LLM代码生成质量，但这些技术的整体有效性尚未得到系统评估。为了填补这一空白，研究者需要对这些技术进行全面的实证研究。

Method: 研究对五种广泛使用的训练数据优化技术及其两两组合进行了大规模实证研究，在三个基准测试和四个大型语言模型上进行评估，重点关注功能正确性、代码异味和可维护性等指标。

Result: 数据合成在提升功能正确性和减少代码异味方面最有效，但在代码可维护性上表现相对较差。大多数组合技术不能进一步提升功能正确性，但能有效改善代码质量（代码异味和可维护性）。数据合成与数据重构的组合在所有组合中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究是理解训练数据优化和组合策略的第一步，为LLM代码生成的未来研究和部署提供了实用指导，强调了数据合成与数据重构组合的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, largely driven by the availability of high-quality code datasets for effective training. To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations for LLM-based code generation across three benchmarks and four LLMs. Our results show that data synthesis is the most effective technique for improving functional correctness and reducing code smells, although it performs relatively worse on code maintainability compared to data refactoring, cleaning, and selection. Regarding combinations, we find that most combinations do not further improve functional correctness but can effectively enhance code quality (code smells and maintainability). Among all combinations, data synthesis combined with data refactoring achieves the strongest overall performance. Furthermore, our fine-grained analysis reinforces these findings and provides deeper insights into how individual techniques and their combinations influence code generation effectiveness. Overall, this work represents a first step toward a systematic understanding of training data optimization and combination strategies, offering practical guidance for future research and deployment in LLM-based code generation.

Motivation: 大规模软件和硬件系统的完全自动化验证是形式化方法的终极目标。虽然大语言模型在提升形式化验证自动化程度方面显示出潜力，但在长上下文推理和复杂跨过程规约推断方面存在可扩展性问题。

Method: Preguss采用分治策略，结合静态分析和演绎验证：1）基于潜在运行时错误构建和优先化验证单元；2）在单元级别使用LLM辅助合成跨过程规约。

Result: Preguss显著优于最先进的基于LLM的方法，能够对超过千行代码的实际程序进行高度自动化的RTE无错误验证，减少了80.6%~88.9%的人工验证工作量。

Conclusion: Preguss通过模块化、细粒度的框架有效解决了大规模程序形式化验证的自动化问题，在减少人工干预的同时提升了验证效率。

Abstract: Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DynaFix是一种基于执行级动态信息的自动程序修复方法，通过迭代利用运行时信息（变量状态、控制流路径、调用栈）来指导大语言模型生成补丁，显著提升了复杂bug修复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的自动程序修复方法主要依赖静态分析，忽略运行时行为；即使尝试融入动态信号，也仅限于训练或一次性注入提示，无法迭代利用执行级信息。现有迭代修复框架通常依赖粗粒度反馈（通过/失败结果或异常类型），未能有效利用细粒度执行级信息，限制了模型模拟人类逐步调试的能力。

Method: DynaFix是一种执行级动态信息驱动的APR方法，在每轮修复中捕获变量状态、控制流路径和调用栈等运行时信息，将其转换为结构化提示来指导大语言模型生成候选补丁。如果补丁验证失败，系统重新执行修改后的程序收集新的执行信息进行下一轮尝试，形成类似人类逐步调试的迭代循环。

Result: 在Defects4J v1.2和v2.0基准测试中，DynaFix修复了186个单函数bug，相比最先进的基线方法提升了10%，包括38个之前未被修复的bug。系统最多在35次尝试内获得正确补丁，相比现有方法将补丁搜索空间减少了70%。

Conclusion: DynaFix通过迭代利用执行级动态信息，有效模拟了人类逐步调试过程，显著提升了自动程序修复在复杂bug修复中的效果和效率，为基于大语言模型的程序修复提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate correct patches for buggy programs. Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.
  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.

Motivation: 量子软件工程对于确保混合量子-经典系统的可靠性和可维护性至关重要，但目前缺乏关于量子项目中缺陷如何产生和影响质量的实证证据。

Method: 采用混合方法：结合仓库挖掘、静态代码分析、问题元数据提取和验证过的基于规则的分类框架，分析2012-2024年间123个开源量子仓库的32,296个已验证缺陷报告。

Result: 全栈库和编译器是最易出错的类别；经典缺陷主要影响可用性和互操作性，量子特定缺陷则严重降低性能、可维护性和可靠性；生态系统趋于成熟，缺陷密度在2017-2021年达到峰值后下降；采用自动化测试的仓库能检测更多缺陷并更快解决问题。

Conclusion: 这是首次大规模数据驱动的量子软件缺陷特征描述，为改进量子软件工程中的测试、文档和维护实践提供了实证指导。

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of hybrid quantum-classical systems, yet empirical evidence on how bugs emerge and affect quality in real-world quantum projects remains limited. This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software defects across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with defect densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity defects cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more defects and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected defect incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software defects and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.

Motivation: 现有基于函数相似性检测bug的方法受到无关语句噪声干扰的影响，特别是目标代码中的噪声抑制问题尚未得到有效解决

Method: 从buggy查询和目标代码中提取特征切片来表示（潜在）bug逻辑的语义特征，利用buggy代码的先验知识指导目标切片，以端到端方式精确定位目标中的切片标准，然后基于向量相似性进行嵌入和比较

Result: MATUS在真实世界项目中具有bug检测优势且效率可接受，在Linux内核中发现了31个未知bug，全部得到内核开发者确认，其中11个被分配了CVE编号

Conclusion: MATUS通过抑制目标噪声实现了更精确的bug检测，证明了其在真实项目中的有效性和实用性

Abstract: Measuring the function similarity to detect bugs is effective, but the statements unrelated to the bugs can impede the performance due to the noise interference. Suppressing the noise interference in existing works does not manage the tough job, i.e., eliminating the noise in the targets. In this paper, we propose MATUS to mitigate the target noise for precise bug detection based on similarity measurement. Feature slices are extracted from both the buggy query and the targets to represent the semantic feature of (potential) bug logics. In particular, MATUS guides the target slicing with the prior knowledge from the buggy code, in an end-to-end way to pinpoint the slicing criterion in the targets. All feature slices are embedded and compared based on the vector similarity. Buggy candidates are audited to confirm unknown bugs in the targets. Experiments show that MATUS holds advantages in bug detection for real-world projects with acceptable efficiency. In total, MATUS has spotted 31 unknown bugs in the Linux kernel. All of them have been confirmed by the kernel developers, and 11 have been assigned CVEs.

Conclusion: 通过微服务架构和多重安全设计，成功开发出能够在高并发场景下保持稳定可靠的铁路售票系统，解决了传统线下购票排队时间长、信息延迟等问题，实现了完整的在线售票流程。

Abstract: The railway ticketing system is one of the most important public service infrastructure. In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the "add passenger" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is increasingly used to transform large language models into agentic systems that act over long horizons, invoke tools, and manage memory under partial observability. While recent work has demonstrated performance gains through tool learning, verifiable rewards, and continual training, deployed self-improving agents raise unresolved security and governance challenges: optimization pressure can incentivize reward hacking, behavioral drift is difficult to audit or reproduce, and improvements are often entangled in opaque parameter updates rather than reusable, verifiable artifacts.
  This paper proposes Audited Skill-Graph Self-Improvement (ASG-SI), a framework that treats self-improvement as iterative compilation of an agent into a growing, auditable skill graph. Each candidate improvement is extracted from successful trajectories, normalized into a skill with an explicit interface, and promoted only after passing verifier-backed replay and contract checks. Rewards are decomposed into reconstructible components derived from replayable evidence, enabling independent audit of promotion decisions and learning signals. ASG-SI further integrates experience synthesis for scalable stress testing and continual memory control to preserve long-horizon performance under bounded context.
  We present a complete system architecture, threat model, and security analysis, and provide a fully runnable reference implementation that demonstrates verifier-backed reward construction, skill compilation, audit logging, and measurable improvement under continual task streams. ASG-SI reframes agentic self-improvement as accumulation of verifiable, reusable capabilities, offering a practical path toward reproducible evaluation and operational governance of self-improving AI agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向多集群云环境的治理感知、意图驱动的API网关协调管理架构，通过高层声明式意图统一管理安全、治理和性能目标，显著减少了策略漂移并提升了配置传播效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多云和混合云部署的普及，在异构网关环境中保持一致的策略执行、可预测的性能和操作稳定性变得日益困难。现有方法通常将安全、治理和性能作为松散耦合的关注点处理，导致配置漂移、策略传播延迟以及动态工作负载下的运行时行为不稳定。

Method: 提出治理感知、意图驱动的架构，将安全、治理和性能目标表达为高层声明式意图，系统性地转换为可执行的网关配置，并通过策略验证和遥测驱动的反馈持续验证。通过解耦意图规范与执行，同时支持有界、策略合规的适配，该架构支持异构网关实现而不损害治理保证或服务级别目标。

Result: 在多个Kubernetes集群上的原型实现显示，与手动和声明式基线方法相比，策略漂移减少高达42%，配置传播时间改善31%，在可变工作负载下p95延迟开销持续低于6%。

Conclusion: 治理感知、意图驱动的网关编排为安全、一致且性能可预测的云原生平台提供了可扩展且可靠的基础，能够有效应对多集群云环境中的API网关管理挑战。

Abstract: API gateways serve as critical enforcement points for security, governance, and traffic management in cloud-native systems. As organizations increasingly adopt multi-cluster and hybrid cloud deployments, maintaining consistent policy enforcement, predictable performance, and operational stability across heterogeneous gateway environments becomes challenging. Existing approaches typically manage security, governance, and performance as loosely coupled concerns, leading to configuration drift, delayed policy propagation, and unstable runtime behavior under dynamic workloads. This paper presents a governance-aware, intent-driven architecture for coordinated API gateway management in multi-cluster cloud environments. The proposed approach expresses security, governance, and performance objectives as high-level declarative intents, which are systematically translated into enforceable gateway configurations and continuously validated through policy verification and telemetry-driven feedback. By decoupling intent specification from enforcement while enabling bounded, policy-compliant adaptation, the architecture supports heterogeneous gateway implementations without compromising governance guarantees or service-level objectives. A prototype implementation across multiple Kubernetes clusters demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design. Experimental results show up to a 42% reduction in policy drift, a 31% improvement in configuration propagation time, and sustained p95 latency overhead below 6% under variable workloads, compared to manual and declarative baseline approaches. These results indicate that governance-aware, intent-driven gateway orchestration provides a scalable and reliable foundation for secure, consistent, and performance-predictable cloud-native platforms.

TL;DR: SyncGait是一种基于步态的无人机配送隐式双向认证系统，利用用户行走时的独特手臂摆动模式进行认证，无需额外硬件或特定认证动作，在远距离（>18米）下达到99.84%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机配送中需要确保无人机与用户之间的安全认证，现有认证方案存在距离限制和抗攻击能力不足的问题。由于配送无人机昂贵且可能携带贵重包裹，必须在用户-无人机双向认证确认前保持安全距离。

Method: SyncGait利用用户走向无人机时的独特手臂摆动模式进行隐式步态认证。系统通过分析用户行走时的步态特征实现双向认证，无需额外硬件或特定认证动作。

Result: 在31名受试者的14个数据集上进行广泛实验，结果显示SyncGait在远距离（>18米）下达到99.84%的平均准确率，并对各种欺骗攻击表现出强大的抗性。

Conclusion: SyncGait为无人机配送提供了一个鲁棒、安全且用户友好的隐式双向认证解决方案，能够在真实场景中有效工作。

Abstract: In recent years, drone delivery, which utilizes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for package delivery and pickup, has gradually emerged as a crucial method in logistics. Since delivery drones are expensive and may carry valuable packages, they must maintain a safe distance from individuals until user-drone mutual authentication is confirmed. Despite numerous authentication schemes being developed, existing solutions are limited in authentication distance and lack resilience against sophisticated attacks. To this end, we introduce SyncGait, an implicit gait-based mutual authentication system for drone delivery. SyncGait leverages the user's unique arm swing as he walks toward the drone to achieve mutual authentication without requiring additional hardware or specific authentication actions. We conducted extensive experiments on 14 datasets collected from 31 subjects. The results demonstrate that SyncGait achieves an average accuracy of 99.84\% at a long distance ($>18m$) and exhibits strong resilience against various spoofing attacks, making it a robust, secure, and user-friendly solution in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 该综述论文系统总结了电力侧信道攻击的多样化应用场景，并提供了相应的防御措施，为研究人员和实践者提供了该领域的全面参考

Abstract: Side-channel attacks try to extract secret information from a system by analyzing different side-channel signatures, such as power consumption, electromagnetic emanation, thermal dissipation, acoustics, time, etc. Power-based side-channel attack is one of the most prominent side-channel attacks in cybersecurity, which rely on data-dependent power variations in a system to extract sensitive information. While there are related surveys, they primarily focus on power side-channel attacks on cryptographic implementations. In recent years, power-side channel attacks have been explored in diverse application domains, including key extraction from cryptographic implementations, reverse engineering of machine learning models, user behavior data exploitation, and instruction-level disassembly. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of power side-channel attacks and their countermeasures in different application domains. Specifically, this survey aims to classify recent power side-channel attacks and provide a comprehensive comparison based on application-specific considerations.

*Samaresh Kumar Singh,Joyjit Roy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出EDS框架，通过经济成本放大使攻击在经济上不可行，适用于资源受限的IoT/边缘环境


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于检测的安全方法在IoT/边缘环境中面临挑战：资源限制无法部署ML入侵检测，而攻击者使用加密、隐身和低速率技术难以检测

Method: EDS框架包含四个机制：自适应计算谜题、诱饵驱动的交互熵、时间拉伸和带宽征税，通过Stackelberg博弈建模，实现超线性成本放大

Result: 在20设备IoT测试床上评估：攻击减速32-560倍，成本不对称比85-520:1，攻击成功率降低8-62%，延迟开销<20ms，假阳性接近0%；对抗IoT-23恶意软件实现88%缓解

Conclusion: EDS提供独立于检测的保护，适合资源受限环境，将经济平衡转向防御方，即使没有IDS也能提供保护

Abstract: Detection-based security fails against sophisticated attackers using encryption, stealth, and low-rate techniques, particularly in IoT/edge environments where resource constraints preclude ML-based intrusion detection. We present Economic Denial Security (EDS), a detection-independent framework that makes attacks economically infeasible by exploiting a fundamental asymmetry: defenders control their environment while attackers cannot. EDS composes four mechanisms adaptive computational puzzles, decoy-driven interaction entropy, temporal stretching, and bandwidth taxation achieving provably superlinear cost amplification. We formalize EDS as a Stackelberg game, deriving closed-form equilibria for optimal parameter selection (Theorem 1) and proving that mechanism composition yields 2.1x greater costs than the sum of individual mechanisms (Theorem 2). EDS requires < 12KB memory, enabling deployment on ESP32 class microcontrollers. Evaluation on a 20-device heterogeneous IoT testbed across four attack scenarios (n = 30 trials, p < 0.001) demonstrates: 32-560x attack slowdown, 85-520:1 cost asymmetry, 8-62% attack success reduction, < 20ms latency overhead, and close to 0% false positives. Validation against IoT-23 malware (Mirai, Torii, Hajime) shows 88% standalone mitigation; combined with ML-IDS, EDS achieves 94% mitigation versus 67% for IDS alone a 27% improvement. EDS provides detection-independent protection suitable for resource-constrained environments where traditional approaches fail. The ability to detect and mitigate the malware samples tested was enhanced; however, the benefits provided by EDS were realized even without the inclusion of an IDS. Overall, the implementation of EDS serves to shift the economic balance in favor of the defender and provides a viable method to protect IoT and edge systems methodologies.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MoE架构中的路由机制存在安全漏洞，攻击者可通过构造重复token模式的对抗性提示，使所有token都路由到相同的top-k专家，造成设备负载不均衡，将效率机制转化为拒绝服务攻击向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合专家架构已成为扩展大语言模型的标准方法，但在实际推理系统中，由于缺乏明确的负载平衡约束，攻击者可以利用路由机制漏洞，通过对抗性输入引发严重的路由集中问题，将效率机制转化为拒绝服务攻击。

Method: 提出了RepetitionCurse方法，这是一种低成本的黑盒攻击策略。该方法通过识别MoE路由器行为的普遍缺陷，使用简单的重复token模式以模型无关的方式构造对抗性提示，从而操纵路由策略。

Result: 在广泛部署的MoE模型如Mixtral-8x7B上，该方法使端到端推理延迟增加了3.063倍，显著降低了服务可用性，验证了MoE架构在推理过程中的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: MoE架构的路由机制存在严重的安全漏洞，攻击者可以通过构造特定的对抗性提示操纵路由策略，造成设备负载不均衡和推理延迟显著增加。这揭示了当前MoE推理系统需要加强负载平衡约束和安全防护机制。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts architectures have become the standard for scaling large language models due to their superior parameter efficiency. To accommodate the growing number of experts in practice, modern inference systems commonly adopt expert parallelism to distribute experts across devices. However, the absence of explicit load balancing constraints during inference allows adversarial inputs to trigger severe routing concentration. We demonstrate that out-of-distribution prompts can manipulate the routing strategy such that all tokens are consistently routed to the same set of top-$k$ experts, which creates computational bottlenecks on certain devices while forcing others to idle. This converts an efficiency mechanism into a denial-of-service attack vector, leading to violations of service-level agreements for time to first token. We propose RepetitionCurse, a low-cost black-box strategy to exploit this vulnerability. By identifying a universal flaw in MoE router behavior, RepetitionCurse constructs adversarial prompts using simple repetitive token patterns in a model-agnostic manner. On widely deployed MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B, our method increases end-to-end inference latency by 3.063x, degrading service availability significantly.

*Yuan Xin,Dingfan Chen,Linyi Yang,Michael Backes,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统评估了针对LLM安全对齐的越狱攻击在整个推理流程中的实际成功率，发现现有评估可能高估了攻击效果，因为大多数越狱技术至少能被一个安全过滤器检测到。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注模型本身，忽略了实际部署中通常包含内容审核过滤器等额外安全机制的完整推理流程，这可能导致对越狱攻击成功率的过高估计。

Method: 首次系统评估越狱攻击在完整推理流程中的表现，包括输入和输出过滤阶段，评估多种越狱技术在不同安全过滤器下的检测情况。

Result: 两个关键发现：1) 几乎所有评估的越狱技术至少能被一个安全过滤器检测到；2) 安全过滤器虽然有效，但在召回率和精确度平衡方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 现有评估可能高估了越狱攻击的实际成功率，需要进一步优化LLM安全系统的检测准确性和可用性，在保护效果和用户体验之间取得更好平衡。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed, ensuring their safe use is paramount. Jailbreaking, adversarial prompts that bypass model alignment to trigger harmful outputs, present significant risks, with existing studies reporting high success rates in evading common LLMs. However, previous evaluations have focused solely on the models, neglecting the full deployment pipeline, which typically incorporates additional safety mechanisms like content moderation filters. To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment, assessing their success across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages. Our findings yield two key insights: first, nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting that prior assessments may have overestimated the practical success of these attacks; second, while safety filters are effective in detection, there remains room to better balance recall and precision to further optimize protection and user experience. We highlight critical gaps and call for further refinement of detection accuracy and usability in LLM safety systems.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在零知识证明中高效执行点面测试的方法，通过比较不同区域编码方式对精度和证明成本的影响，提出了基于距离感知的网格编码方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多基于位置的服务依赖于点面测试，但几何操作在零知识证明中计算成本高昂，因此需要寻找高效的隐私保护空间检查方法。

Method: 在固定的STARK执行模型下，探索网格查找表的不同区域编码方式：1）布尔网格基线（标记单元格在区域内/外）；2）距离感知编码方法（存储每个单元格到区域边界的距离，并使用插值在单元格内推理）。

Result: 在真实世界数据上的实验表明，距离感知方法在粗网格上实现了更高的精度（最大60%的精度提升），验证开销仅适度增加（约1.4倍）。

Conclusion: 区域编码是实现高效零知识空间检查的关键杠杆，距离感知方法在精度和成本之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Many location-based services rely on a point-in-polygon test (PiP), checking whether a point or a trajectory lies inside a geographic zone. Since geometric operations are expensive in zero-knowledge proofs, privately performing the PiP test is challenging. In this paper, we answer the research questions of how different ways of encoding zones affect accuracy and proof cost by exploiting gridbased lookup tables under a fixed STARK execution model. Beyond a Boolean grid-based baseline that marks cells as in- or outside, we explore a distance-aware encoding approach that stores how far each cell is from a zone boundary and uses interpolation to reason within a cell. Our experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed distance-aware approach achieves higher accuracy on coarse grids (max. 60%p accuracy gain) with only a moderate verification overhead (approximately 1.4x), making zone encoding the key lever for efficient zero-knowledge spatial checks.

Motivation: 可信处理器能保护数据隐私，但传统数据无感知算法会导致性能下降。为了解决这个问题，研究者探索在处理器中集成隐蔽内存(OM)，其访问对攻击者不可见，特别针对易受访问模式攻击的图分析应用。

Method: 采用存储结构与算法的协同设计方法，在处理器中集成隐蔽内存(OM)，使得内存访问对攻击者不可观察。针对图分析应用，设计专门的系统原型，OM大小接近单核缓存。

Result: 原型系统比基线快100倍，且OM大小接近单核缓存，可在现有处理器上以可忽略的开销实现。这为在可信处理器中配备OM提供了重要见解。

Conclusion: 通过在可信处理器中集成隐蔽内存(OM)，结合存储结构与算法的协同设计，可以显著提升图分析等易受访问模式攻击应用的性能，同时保持数据隐私保护，为可信处理器设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Trusted processors provide a way to perform joint computations while preserving data privacy. To overcome the performance degradation caused by data-oblivious algorithms to prevent information leakage, we explore the benefits of oblivious memory (OM) integrated in processors, to which the accesses are unobservable by adversaries. We focus on graph analytics, an important application vulnerable to access-pattern attacks. With a co-design between storage structure and algorithms, our prototype system is 100x faster than baselines given an OM sized around the per-core cache which can be implemented on existing processors with negligible overhead. This gives insights into equipping trusted processors with OM.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SourceRank评分系统在对抗恶意软件包伪装攻击方面存在可靠性问题，特别是URL混淆技术可以影响5个指标，且现实世界中良性包和恶意包的SourceRank分布重叠严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管SourceRank已被多项研究使用，但尚未有研究深入分析其对抗旨在提高恶意软件包评分的规避攻击的可靠性。需要填补这一空白，评估SourceRank在现实场景中区分良性和恶意软件包的能力。

Method: 首先提出威胁模型，识别每个指标的潜在规避方法，包括URL混淆技术。然后分析PyPI生态系统中SourceRank的可靠性：1) 在MalwareBench数据集上分析良性和恶意包的SourceRank分布；2) 在包含122,398个包的真实世界数据集上进行相同分析。

Result: 1) 历史数据显示良性和恶意包有明显区别，但真实世界分布显著重叠，主要原因是SourceRank未能及时反映软件包移除；2) URL混淆技术使用率从MalwareBench的4.2%增加到真实数据集的7.0%，常与其他规避技术结合使用，能显著提高恶意包的SourceRank指标。

Conclusion: SourceRank无法在现实场景中可靠地区分良性和恶意软件包，也不能用于在PyPI上选择良性包。URL混淆是一个新兴的攻击向量，需要改进SourceRank系统以应对此类规避攻击。

Abstract: SourceRank is a scoring system made of 18 metrics that assess the popularity and quality of open-source packages. Despite being used in several recent studies, none has thoroughly analyzed its reliability against evasion attacks aimed at inflating the score of malicious packages, thereby masquerading them as trustworthy. To fill this gap, we first propose a threat model that identifies potential evasion approaches for each metric, including the URL confusion technique, which can affect 5 out of the 18 metrics by leveraging a URL pointing to a legitimate repository potentially unrelated to the malicious package.
  Furthermore, we study the reliability of SourceRank in the PyPI ecosystem by analyzing the SourceRank distributions of benign and malicious packages in the state-of-the-art MalwareBench dataset, as well as in a real-world dataset of 122,398 packages. Our analysis reveals that, while historical data suggests a clear distinction between benign and malicious packages, the real-world distributions overlap significantly, mainly due to SourceRank's failure to timely reflect package removals. As a result, SourceRank cannot be reliably used to discriminate between benign and malicious packages in real-world scenarios, nor to select benign packages among those available on PyPI.
  Finally, our analysis reveals that URL confusion represents an emerging attack vector, with its prevalence increasing from 4.2% in MalwareBench to 7.0% in our real-world dataset. Moreover, this technique is often used alongside other evasion techniques and can significantly inflate the SourceRank metrics of malicious packages.

Abstract: Recording entry and exit records for a country, with properties such as confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, is increasingly important due to rising international mobility and security requirements. Traditional border control systems, which rely on centralised databases, are vulnerable to data manipulation and have limited interoperability between institutions. This study presents GateChain, a blockchain-based application that addresses these vulnerabilities. GateChain aims to enhance data integrity, reliability, and transparency by recording entry and exit events on a distributed, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable ledger. The application provides real-time access control and verification for authorised institutions. This paper describes the architecture and security components of GateChain and evaluates its performance and security features.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了简化房地产交易、增强利益相关者信任以及实现可扩展、安全数字流程的潜力。

Abstract: The real estate sector remains highly dependent on manual document handling and verification, making processes inefficient and prone to fraud. This work presents a system that integrates optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and verifiable credentials (VCs) to automate document extraction, verification, and management. The approach standardizes heterogeneous document formats into VCs and applies automated data matching to detect inconsistencies, while the blockchain provides a decentralized trust layer that reinforces transparency and integrity. A prototype was developed that comprises (i) an OCR-NLP extraction pipeline trained on synthetic datasets, (ii) a backend for credential issuance and management, and (iii) a frontend supporting issuer, holder, and verifier interactions. Experimental results show that the models achieve competitive accuracy across multiple document types and that the end-to-end pipeline reduces verification time while preserving reliability. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential to streamline real estate transactions, strengthen stakeholder trust, and enable scalable, secure digital processes.

Abstract: This paper proposes an alternative approach to formally establishing the correctness of the RSA public key cryptosystem. The methodology presented herein deviates slightly from conventional proofs found in existing literature. Specifically, this study explores the conditions under which the choice of the positive integer N, a fundamental component of RSA, can be extended beyond the standard selection criteria. We derive explicit conditions that determine when certain values of N are valid for the encryption scheme and explain why others may fail to satisfy the correctness requirements. The scope of this paper is limited to the mathematical proof of correctness for RSA-like schemes, deliberately omitting issues related to the cryptographic security of RSA.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SynRAG是一个统一框架，能够从平台无关的规范自动为多个SIEM平台生成威胁检测或事件调查查询，解决了不同SIEM平台查询语言差异带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIEM平台（如Qradar、Google SecOps、Splunk等）在属性、架构和查询语言上存在显著差异，导致安全分析师需要为每个平台单独编写查询，需要大量培训或增加人力，跨平台威胁检测效率低下。

Method: 提出SynRAG框架，分析师只需编写单一高级规范，框架自动生成针对特定SIEM平台的查询。评估时使用Qradar和SecOps作为代表性SIEM系统，并与GPT、Llama、DeepSeek、Gemma、Claude等先进语言模型进行对比。

Result: SynRAG在跨SIEM威胁检测和事件调查查询生成方面，相比最先进的基准模型（GPT、Llama等）表现显著更好。

Conclusion: SynRAG框架能够实现异构SIEM环境下的无缝威胁检测和事件调查，减少了对专业培训和手动查询翻译的需求，提高了安全运营效率。

Abstract: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are essential for large enterprises to monitor their IT infrastructure by ingesting and analyzing millions of logs and events daily. Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种可追踪的超阈值多方私有集合交集协议，显著提升了现有方案的计算效率和安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多方私有集合交集中，传统方案要求元素出现在所有参与方集合中，而超阈值方案允许元素出现在至少t个参与方集合中。然而，在数字取证等场景中，不仅需要知道交集元素，还需要知道哪些参与方拥有这些元素以确保可追溯性和可靠性。现有可追踪超阈值多方PSI协议研究有限，且计算成本高、安全假设强。

Method: 提出了两种协议：1) ET-OT-MP-PSI：结合Shamir秘密共享和可编程伪随机函数，抵抗最多t-2个半诚实参与方；2) ST-OT-MP-PSI：进一步利用不经意线性求值协议，抵抗最多n-1个半诚实参与方，消除了特殊参与方不共谋的假设。

Result: 实验结果表明，在n=5、t=3、集合大小为2^14的设置下，ET-OT-MP-PSI比Mahdavi等人的协议快15056倍，ST-OT-MP-PSI快505倍，且安全性更强。

Conclusion: 本文提出的两种可追踪超阈值多方PSI协议在效率和安全性方面均有显著提升，ET-OT-MP-PSI适合对效率要求高的场景，ST-OT-MP-PSI适合对安全性要求更高的场景，为实际应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Party Private Set Intersection (MP-PSI) with threshold enhances the flexibility of MP-PSI by disclosing elements present in at least $t$ participants' sets, rather than requiring elements to appear in all $n$ sets. In scenarios where each participant is responsible for its dataset, e.g., digital forensics, MP-PSI with threshold should disclose both intersection elements and corresponding holders such that elements are traceable and the reliability of intersection is guaranteed. We refer to MP-PSI with threshold supporting traceability as Traceable Over-Threshold MP-PSI (T-OT-MP-PSI). However, research on such protocols remains limited, and existing work tolerates at most $t-2$ semi-honest participants at considerable computational cost. We propose two novel Traceable OT-MP-PSI protocols. The first, Efficient Traceable OT-MP-PSI (ET-OT-MP-PSI), combines Shamir's secret sharing with an oblivious programmable pseudorandom function, achieving significantly improved efficiency with resistance to at most $t-2$ semi-honest participants. The second, Security-enhanced Traceable OT-MP-PSI (ST-OT-MP-PSI), achieves security against up to $n-1$ semi-honest participants by further leveraging the oblivious linear evaluation protocol. Compared to Mahdavi et al.'s protocol, ours eliminate the assumption that certain special parties do not collude. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: for $n=5$, $t=3$, and sets of size $2^{14}$, ET-OT-MP-PSI achieves $15056\times$ speedup and ST-OT-MP-PSI achieves $505\times$ speedup over Mahdavi et al.'s protocol.

TL;DR: MTSP-LDP是一个新颖的多任务流数据发布框架，在w-事件本地差分隐私下，通过动态隐私预算分配、自适应私有二叉树结构和无预算多任务处理机制，解决了现有方法无法处理复杂查询和忽略时间相关性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流数据分析应用中直接收集用户数据会危及个人隐私。现有的w-事件本地差分隐私机制虽然提供形式化保证，但存在两个关键限制：1) 主要设计用于发布简单统计量，不适合复杂查询；2) 独立处理每个时间戳数据，忽略了时间相关性，降低了整体效用。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，MTSP-LDP在各种流任务中始终实现高效用，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTSP-LDP有效解决了现有w-事件本地差分隐私机制的局限性，通过创新的隐私预算分配、数据结构设计和多任务处理机制，为流数据发布提供了既保护隐私又支持复杂查询的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of streaming data analytics in data-driven applications raises critical privacy concerns, as directly collecting user data may compromise personal privacy. Although existing $w$-event local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms provide formal guarantees without relying on trusted third parties, their practical deployment is hindered by two key limitations. First, these methods are designed primarily for publishing simple statistics at each timestamp, making them inherently unsuitable for complex queries. Second, they handle data at each timestamp independently, failing to capture temporal correlations and consequently degrading the overall utility. To address these issues, we propose MTSP-LDP, a novel framework for \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}treaming data \textbf{P}ublication under $w$-event LDP. MTSP-LDP adopts an \emph{Optimal Privacy Budget Allocation} algorithm to dynamically allocate privacy budgets by analyzing temporal correlations within each window. It then constructs a \emph{data-adaptive private binary tree structure} to support complex queries, which is further refined by cross-timestamp grouping and smoothing operations to enhance estimation accuracy. Furthermore, a unified \emph{Budget-Free Multi-Task Processing} mechanism is introduced to support a variety of streaming queries without consuming additional privacy budget. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MTSP-LDP consistently achieves high utility across various streaming tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为可靠共识采样（RCS）的新方法，用于解决现有共识采样（CS）算法在生成式AI安全中的缺陷，通过追踪接受概率来提高对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时完全消除弃权需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI安全研究主要基于经验驱动的攻防方法，容易产生未知攻击绕过现有检测机制。共识采样（CS）算法虽然朝着可证明安全AI方向发展，但存在两个主要问题：1）需要频繁弃权来避免不安全输出，降低了实用性；2）当不安全模型被恶意操纵时变得高度脆弱。

Method: 提出可靠共识采样（RCS）新原语，通过追踪接受概率来容忍极端对抗行为，提高鲁棒性。RCS完全消除了弃权需求。进一步开发了反馈算法，持续动态增强RCS的安全性。提供了理论保证，证明RCS能够维持可控的风险阈值。

Result: 大量实验表明，RCS在保持与CS相当的延迟的同时，显著提高了鲁棒性和实用性。该方法为开发可证明安全的生成式AI做出了贡献。

Conclusion: RCS通过改进共识采样算法，解决了现有方法在对抗攻击下的脆弱性和实用性不足的问题，为实现具有理论可控风险的生成式AI安全提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing research on generative AI security is primarily driven by mutually reinforcing attack and defense methodologies grounded in empirical experience. This dynamic frequently gives rise to previously unknown attacks that can circumvent current detection and prevention. This necessitates the continual updating of security mechanisms. Constructing generative AI with provable security and theoretically controllable risk is therefore necessary. Consensus Sampling (CS) is a promising algorithm toward provably secure AI. It controls risk by leveraging overlap in model output probabilities. However, we find that CS relies on frequent abstention to avoid unsafe outputs, which reduces utility. Moreover, CS becomes highly vulnerable when unsafe models are maliciously manipulated. To address these issues, we propose a new primitive called Reliable Consensus Sampling (RCS), that traces acceptance probability to tolerate extreme adversarial behaviors, improving robustness. RCS also eliminates the need for abstention entirely. We further develop a feedback algorithm to continuously and dynamically enhance the safety of RCS. We provide theoretical guarantees that RCS maintains a controllable risk threshold. Extensive experiments show that RCS significantly improves robustness and utility while maintaining latency comparable to CS. We hope this work contributes to the development of provably secure generative AI.

### [166] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了DDFT评估框架，用于衡量语言模型在语义压缩和对抗性干扰下的认知稳健性，发现模型稳健性与传统设计参数无关，而与错误检测能力密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估主要关注理想条件下的知识表现，但无法衡量模型在现实压力下的稳健性。静态基准测试无法区分模型是缺乏知识还是验证机制在信息退化或对抗性攻击下崩溃。

Method: 引入Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT)协议，提出两系统认知模型：语义系统生成流畅文本，认知验证器验证事实准确性。评估了9个前沿模型在8个知识领域和5个压缩级别下的表现（共1800次轮级评估）。

Result: 认知稳健性与传统设计范式正交：参数数量(r=0.083, p=0.832)和架构类型(r=0.153, p=0.695)对稳健性无显著预测作用。错误检测能力强烈预测整体稳健性(rho=-0.817, p=0.007)。旗舰模型表现出脆弱性，而较小模型可实现稳健性能。

Conclusion: 认知稳健性源于训练方法和验证机制，而非当前主流设计方法。DDFT框架为关键应用部署前的认知稳健性评估提供了理论基础和实用工具，挑战了模型大小与可靠性关系的传统假设。

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

Motivation: 准确的疾病预测对及时干预、有效治疗和减少医疗并发症至关重要。虽然符号AI已在医疗保健中应用，但由于构建高质量知识库需要大量努力，其采用仍然有限

Method: McCoy框架结合大语言模型和答案集编程，使用LLM将医学文献翻译成ASP代码，然后结合患者数据，通过ASP求解器处理得出最终诊断

Result: 初步结果显示McCoy在小规模疾病诊断任务上表现出色

Conclusion: 这种集成产生了一个稳健、可解释的预测框架，充分利用了两种范式的优势

Abstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

TL;DR: SPARK是一个基于多智能体LLM的个性化搜索框架，通过角色化智能体协作实现动态检索和个性化，模拟人类信息搜索的复杂性和情境敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化搜索系统受限于静态用户画像和单一检索流程，无法捕捉用户动态、多维的信息需求变化。需要一种能够建模用户演化需求、支持情境敏感检索的新方法。

Method: SPARK框架定义了包含角色、专业领域、任务上下文和领域的角色空间，通过角色协调器动态激活相关专业智能体。每个智能体执行独立的检索增强生成过程，配备长短期记忆存储和情境感知推理模块。智能体间通过结构化通信协议（共享内存库、迭代辩论、接力式知识传递）进行协作。

Result: 该框架提出了关于协调效率、个性化质量和认知负载分布的可测试预测，并包含自适应学习机制用于持续角色优化。通过细粒度智能体专业化与协作检索的整合，能够捕捉人类信息搜索行为的复杂性、流动性和情境敏感性。

Conclusion: SPARK为下一代搜索系统提供了理论框架，展示了如何通过分布式智能体行为和最小协调规则实现涌现的个性化特性，为建模复杂的人类信息搜索行为提供了新思路。

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

TL;DR: ROAD是一种无需标注数据的自动提示优化框架，通过多智能体架构将失败日志转化为结构化决策树协议，在冷启动场景下实现高效优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动提示优化方法依赖大量标注数据，但在实际软件工程中，冷启动阶段通常只有混乱的生产日志和不断变化的失败模式，缺乏精炼的数据集。

Method: ROAD采用多智能体架构：分析器进行根因分析，优化器进行模式聚合，教练进行策略整合，将非结构化失败日志转化为结构化决策树协议。

Result: 在学术基准和生产知识管理引擎中，ROAD仅通过三次自动迭代就使成功率提升5.6%（73.6%到79.2%），搜索准确率提升3.8%；在零售领域复杂推理任务中，性能相对基线提升约19%。

Conclusion: 模仿人类工程师的失败分析和修复循环，为部署可靠LLM智能体提供了一种数据高效、资源节约的替代方案，避免了资源密集的强化学习训练。

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on large, labeled gold-standard development sets to compute fitness scores for evolutionary or Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.

TL;DR: LoongFlow是一个自进化智能体框架，通过将LLM集成到"计划-执行-总结"认知范式中，解决了传统进化方法在代码空间中的过早收敛和低效探索问题，显著提升了进化效率并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从静态大语言模型向自改进智能体的转变受到传统进化方法缺乏结构化推理的阻碍，现有方法在高维代码空间中经常面临过早收敛和低效探索的问题。

Method: LoongFlow将LLM集成到"计划-执行-总结"认知范式中，采用混合进化记忆系统，结合多岛模型、MAP-Elites和自适应玻尔兹曼选择，平衡探索与利用的权衡，保持行为多样性。

Result: 在AlphaEvolve基准测试和Kaggle竞赛中，LoongFlow比领先基线（如OpenEvolve、ShinkaEvolve）的进化效率高出60%，同时发现了更优的解决方案。

Conclusion: LoongFlow在自主科学发现方面迈出了重要一步，能够以更低的计算开销生成专家级解决方案，标志着从静态LLM到自进化智能体的重要进展。

Abstract: The transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents is hindered by the lack of structured reasoning in traditional evolutionary approaches. Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike "blind" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、基于图结构的交互式推理方法，在ARC-AGI-3基准测试中显著优于当前最先进的LLM模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的LLM无法可靠解决ARC-AGI-3中的交互式推理任务，这些任务需要智能体通过有限交互推断任务机制并适应复杂度递增的关卡

Method: 结合视觉帧处理与系统化的状态空间探索，使用图结构表示：分割视觉帧为有意义的组件，基于视觉显著性优先选择动作，维护已探索状态和转移的有向图，通过追踪已访问状态和测试过的动作，优先选择到达未测试状态-动作对的最短路径

Result: 在ARC-AGI-3预览挑战中，该方法在6个游戏的52个关卡中解决了中位数30个关卡，在私有排行榜上排名第3，显著优于前沿的基于LLM的智能体

Conclusion: 即使无需学习，显式的图结构探索也能作为交互式推理的强大基线，在稀疏反馈环境中系统化的状态追踪和动作优先级排序至关重要，而当前LLM无法捕捉任务动态

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种风险感知的逐步对齐方法（RSA），通过使用嵌套风险度量将风险意识显式地纳入策略优化过程，以解决现有安全对齐方法在应对罕见但潜在灾难性有害行为方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法（如Safe RLHF和SACPO）通常在风险中性范式下运行，不足以应对参考策略偏差带来的风险，且对罕见但潜在灾难性有害行为的鲁棒性有限。需要一种能够明确纳入风险意识的方法来确保语言模型的安全性和可信度。

Method: 提出风险感知逐步对齐（RSA）方法：1）将安全对齐建模为令牌级别的风险感知约束策略优化问题；2）通过逐步对齐过程解决该问题，利用嵌套风险度量推导出令牌级别的策略更新；3）该方法能够缓解因过度偏离参考策略引起的风险，并显式抑制低概率高影响的有害行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持高帮助性的同时确保了强大的安全性，并显著抑制了尾部风险（即低概率但高影响的不安全响应）。理论分析在温和假设下证明了策略的最优性。

Conclusion: RSA方法通过将风险意识显式地纳入对齐过程，有效解决了现有方法在风险管理和罕见有害行为抑制方面的局限性，为语言模型的安全对齐提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多使用相同的数据集评估大语言模型的数学推理能力，这限制了研究结果的普适性，可能无法完全捕捉数学任务中的多样化挑战。本研究旨在通过分析大语言模型在代表性不足的数学竞赛问题上的表现，提供更全面的评估。

Method: 研究使用密苏里大学数学竞赛中的微积分、解析几何和离散数学问题，对GPT-4o-mini、Gemini-2.0-Flash和DeepSeek-V3三个大语言模型进行测试。将模型的回答与已知正确答案进行比较，以确定每个问题领域的准确性，并分析模型的推理过程以探索错误模式。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在微积分、解析几何和离散数学三个类别中表现最佳，包括推理过程和最终答案。所有三个大语言模型在几何问题上都表现出明显弱点。DeepSeek-V3的错误主要源于计算和逻辑错误，GPT-4o-mini经常出现逻辑和方法相关的错误，而Gemini则倾向于推理不完整和匆忙得出结论。

Conclusion: 在代表性不足的数学竞赛数据集上评估大语言模型，可以更深入地了解它们独特的错误模式，并突显结构化推理方面的持续挑战，特别是在几何领域。这为未来改进大语言模型的数学推理能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

TL;DR: 论文提出两阶段方法提升大语言模型的空间推理能力：先通过监督微调学习基本空间变换，再通过GRPO框架训练LoRA适配器进行多步规划，在ASCII艺术环境中验证了方法的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在通用语言能力上表现出色，但在结构化环境中的空间变换和多步规划方面仍然存在困难，这限制了其在导航和规划等应用中的表现。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过监督微调学习基本空间变换（旋转、平移、缩放）；第二阶段冻结物理感知模型，在GRPO框架内训练轻量级LoRA适配器，以组合这些基础模块进行多步规划。为此合成了ASCII艺术数据集并构建了相应的强化学习环境。

Result: 该方法在动态环境（有明确状态更新）和静态环境（模型必须依赖内部状态）中均优于基线模型，包括通用骨干模型、物理感知模型和端到端RL模型。此外，该方法收敛更快，训练更稳定，注意力模式分析也显示微调确实改善了空间理解能力。

Conclusion: 将空间推理分解为原子构建块及其组合的两阶段方法有效提升了大语言模型的空间推理能力，在结构化环境中表现出优越性能，为导航和规划应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型处理任意长提示的问题，突破模型上下文窗口的限制，提升长文本处理能力

Method: 提出递归语言模型（RLMs），将长提示视为外部环境，让LLM以编程方式检查、分解并递归调用自身处理提示片段

Result: RLMs成功处理超出模型上下文窗口两个数量级的输入，在四个不同长上下文任务中显著优于基础LLMs和常见长上下文框架，且查询成本相当或更低

Conclusion: RLMs为LLMs处理任意长提示提供了一种有效的推理时扩展策略，在保持成本效益的同时大幅提升长上下文处理能力

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\%) and GAIA (72.8\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\% and +5.4\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\% and 21\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Conclusion: 该框架为电池安全管理提供了从"被动检测"到"智能诊断"的新范式转变，结合物理机理与AI推理能力

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

Motivation: 现有的机器人家庭物品重排系统通常依赖从人类演示中推断的潜在偏好模型，这些模型虽然预测有效，但缺乏对人类决策背后可解释因素的洞察。需要开发一个更明确、可解释的偏好模型来理解人类物品摆放决策背后的因素。

Conclusion: 该研究贡献了一个紧凑、可解释的物品摆放偏好模型，并展示了如何将其操作化用于机器人规划，为理解人类物品摆放决策提供了更明确的框架，同时为机器人系统提供了更可解释的偏好指导。

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenZ是一种混合模型，通过可解释的语义特征桥接基础模型和统计建模，能发现数据集特定模式，在房价预测和电影推荐任务上显著优于纯基础模型方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具有广泛的领域知识，但往往无法捕捉对预测任务至关重要的数据集特定模式。现有方法过度依赖基础模型的领域理解，而忽视了数据集中具体的统计模式。

Method: 提出一种迭代过程，通过统计建模误差对比识别项目组来发现语义特征描述，而不是单纯依赖基础模型的领域知识。将问题形式化为广义EM算法，联合优化语义特征描述符和统计模型参数。使用冻结的基础模型基于发现的特征对项目进行分类，将这些判断视为预测实值目标的潜在二元特征的噪声观测。

Result: 在房价预测任务中，使用多模态列表数据发现的语义特征实现了12%的中位数相对误差，显著优于依赖LLM通用领域知识的GPT-5基线（38%误差）。在Netflix电影嵌入预测中，仅从语义描述就能达到0.59的余弦相似度，相当于传统协同过滤需要约4000个用户评分才能达到的性能。

Conclusion: GenZ成功桥接了基础模型和统计建模，通过可解释的语义特征发现了数据集特定的模式，这些模式与模型单独依赖的领域知识有所不同。该方法在预测性能和可解释性方面都有显著优势。

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

Method: 使用约束模板提取各种组件的组合（如连续工作班次模式、员工组合），通过改变关注的天数、员工数量和提取焦点（模式或频率）来提取多样化约束，并包含排除异常约束的机制

Result: 实验表明，该方法成功创建了满足所有硬约束的排班表，并通过避免提取异常约束减少了软约束的违反次数

Conclusion: 提出的约束模板方法能够有效提取养老机构特定的排班约束条件，结合约束规划求解器可生成符合实际需求的护理人员排班表

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

Abstract: This report presents the design and implementation of a semi-automated data annotation pipeline developed within the DARTS project, whose goal is to create a large-scale, multimodal dataset of driving scenarios recorded in Polish conditions. Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and duration. The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.

Conclusion: 迭代部署机制实际上实现了外层循环的强化学习训练，具有隐式奖励函数，这对AI安全领域有重要启示，同时为强化学习提供了一种基于数据筛选的替代训练范式

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

Motivation: 为了解决时空场景下的复杂任务，如受限兴趣点发现和行程规划，需要专门设计的智能体模型。现有通用模型在时空理解和工具交互方面存在局限，因此需要开发专门针对时空场景的智能体模型。

Conclusion: STAgent通过专门的工具环境、高质量数据筛选和级联训练策略，成功实现了时空场景下的高性能智能体模型，在保持通用能力的同时，在时空理解任务上表现出显著优势。

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.
