Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [2] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统性的评估方法来分析和量化基于修复的说话人脸生成中的嘴唇泄漏问题，包括三种互补的测试设置和衍生指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法虽然能保留视频细节，但容易引入嘴唇泄漏问题，即生成的嘴唇受到参考图像影响而非仅由驱动音频决定，且传统指标难以检测此类问题。

Method: 提出了包含静默输入生成、不匹配音视频配对和匹配音视频合成的三种测试设置，并引入了唇同步差异和基于静默音频的唇同步评分等衍生指标。

Result: 该方法能够有效量化和分析嘴唇泄漏问题，并研究了不同身份参考选择对泄漏的影响，为参考设计提供了见解。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法具有模型无关性，为说话人脸生成领域的未来研究建立了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MATRIX数据集和深度学习框架，用于解决多无人机动态监控中的行人跟踪问题，在复杂遮挡环境下保持约90%的检测和跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以应对动态相机位置和复杂遮挡，需要开发能够处理多无人机动态监控场景的鲁棒解决方案。

Method: 提出MATRIX数据集（8个无人机同步视频）和深度学习框架，包括实时相机标定、基于特征的图像配准、鸟瞰图中的多视角特征融合。

Result: 在复杂环境下保持约90%的检测跟踪精度，成功跟踪约80%的轨迹，迁移学习显示强泛化能力，相机丢失实验显示性能优雅下降。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视角监控系统提供了重要基准，展示了在真实部署中的实用鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTM是一个无需训练、即插即用的视频生成框架，通过粗参考动画实现精确的运动控制，结合图像条件保持外观一致性，在采样过程中引入双时钟去噪策略平衡运动精度和自然动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本条件的扩散视频生成方法无法提供精确的运动控制，而需要特定模型微调的方法计算成本高且限制性强。

Method: 使用用户友好的操作（如剪切拖拽或深度重投影）获取粗参考动画作为运动线索，结合图像条件保持外观，采用双时钟去噪策略在运动指定区域强制强对齐，同时允许其他区域的灵活性。

Result: 在物体和相机运动基准测试中，TTM在真实感和运动控制方面达到或超过现有基于训练的基线方法，并实现了通过像素级条件进行精确外观控制的独特能力。

Conclusion: TTM提供了一种轻量级、无需训练的视频生成解决方案，能够精确控制运动和外观，超越了仅使用文本提示的限制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

### [5] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续异常检测框架，使用统一内存库而非任务特定的子内存库，通过增量更新固定大小的核心集来连续学习，在推理阶段使用最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数，在多个数据集上达到最先进的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别的子内存库，限制了灵活性和可扩展性的问题。

Method: 提出所有任务共享统一内存库的框架，在训练期间增量更新固定大小核心集中的嵌入，在推理阶段使用最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上分别达到0.972和0.891的平均图像级AUROC分数，在真实电子纸数据集上实现100%的异常样本检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个数据集上优于现有基线，证明了在实际场景中的鲁棒性，并将开源实现。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

### [6] [Predict and Resist: Long-Term Accident Anticipation under Sensor Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08640)
*Xingcheng Liu,Bin Rao,Yanchen Guan,Chengyue Wang,Haicheng Liao,Jiaxun Zhang,Chengyu Lin,Meixin Zhu,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架，结合扩散去噪和时间感知的actor-critic模型，用于自动驾驶中的事故预测，解决传感器噪声和及时可靠预测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事故预测对于主动安全的自动驾驶至关重要，但面临两个关键挑战：传感器输入噪声或退化，以及需要平衡早期预警与误报抑制的及时可靠预测。

Method: 集成扩散去噪模块（通过迭代细化重建噪声弹性特征）和时间感知actor-critic模型（利用长期时间推理和时间加权奖励确定最佳预警时机）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（DAD、CCD、A3D）上达到最先进精度，显著提高平均事故前时间，在噪声条件下保持鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在常规和复杂交通场景中产生更早、更稳定且与人类对齐的预测，展示了其在现实世界安全关键部署中的潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [7] [RS-Net: Context-Aware Relation Scoring for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08651)
*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出RS-Net，一个用于动态场景图生成的模块化框架，通过空间交互和长程时序上下文来评估对象对的关系重要性，提升关系预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景图生成方法仅在有标注的对象对上训练，缺乏对非相关对象对的指导，导致在推理时难以识别有意义的关系。

Method: RS-Net包含空间上下文编码器（带可学习上下文标记）和时序编码器（聚合视频级信息），通过关系评分机制增强关系预测。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上的实验表明，RS-Net显著提升了召回率和精确率，特别是在平均召回率上有明显改善，有效应对关系的长尾分布问题。

Conclusion: RS-Net可轻松集成到现有DSGG模型中，在保持竞争力的效率下，实现了优于最先进方法的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [8] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级匿名化适配器模块从视频特征中移除隐私信息，同时保持任务实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型提取的时空特征会无意中泄露敏感个人信息（如肤色、性别、服装），而现有的像素级匿名化方法需要重新训练整个模型且仅适用于特定任务。

Method: 设计轻量级匿名化适配器模块（AAM），采用三种训练目标：剪辑级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标和潜在一致性损失，可即插即用地应用于冻结的视频编码器。

Result: 评估显示隐私泄露显著减少35%，同时在动作识别、时序动作检测和异常检测等下游任务中保持接近基线的实用性，并能有效缓解动作识别模型中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频基础模型提供了一种高效、通用的隐私保护解决方案，在保护隐私的同时维持了模型的实用性，并促进了更公平的视频理解。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

*Xinchen Yan,Chen Liang,Lijun Yu,Adams Wei Yu,Yifeng Lu,Quoc V. Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的扩展特性，发现在固定32x32分辨率下，图像分类和图像生成的最优扩展策略存在差异，生成任务需要数据量比分类任务快3-5倍增长。随着分辨率提高，模型大小需要比数据量增长更快。计算能力是主要瓶颈而非训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但研究不足的统一视觉模型框架的扩展特性，了解不同视觉任务的最优扩展策略。

Method: 在32x32分辨率下训练一系列Transformer模型，使用IsoFlops配置文件，计算预算高达7e19 FLOPs，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和生成质量（Fr'echet距离）。

Result: 1) 在固定32x32分辨率下，图像分类和图像生成的最优扩展策略不同，生成任务需要数据量比分类任务快3-5倍增长；2) 随着分辨率提高，模型大小需要比数据量增长更快；3) 主要瓶颈是计算能力而非训练数据量。

Conclusion: 通过预测发现，随着计算能力每年增长4-5倍，未来五年内逐像素图像建模是可行的，计算能力是主要限制因素。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

### [10] [Harnessing Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Images for Fair Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08711)
*Abhipsa Basu,Aviral Gupta,Abhijnya Bhat,R. Venkatesh Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探索了多种扩散模型微调技术（如LoRA和DreamBooth）来生成更准确的平衡训练数据，通过聚类和每个聚类训练DreamBooth模型来处理组内变异，实验表明这些方法优于原始Stable Diffusion，并与SOTA去偏技术性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类系统经常因训练数据中群体代表性不均而继承偏见，例如人脸数据集中金发与女性的过度关联会强化刻板印象。现有方法使用Stable Diffusion生成平衡数据但难以保持原始数据分布。

Method: 采用多种扩散模型微调技术（LoRA和DreamBooth），通过聚类每个组内的图像并训练每个聚类的DreamBooth模型来处理组内变异，然后使用这些模型生成群体平衡数据进行预训练，最后在真实数据上微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，研究的微调方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，与SOTA去偏技术（如Group-DRO）性能相当，且随着数据集偏见严重程度增加而超越它们。

Conclusion: 扩散模型微调技术能够有效生成更准确的平衡训练数据，在减轻图像分类系统偏见方面表现出色，特别是在高偏见场景下优于现有方法。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

*Jiaxun Guo,Manar Amayri,Nizar Bouguila,Xin Liu,Wentao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的旋转不变学习框架，通过引入阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)和旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，解决了现有方法因受限感受野导致的翼尖特征崩溃问题，能够在保持旋转不变性的同时保留全局姿态信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转不变学习方法使用手工设计的RI特征替代原始坐标，虽然保证了旋转鲁棒性，但丢失了全局姿态信息，无法区分几何相似但空间位置不同的结构。这源于受限感受野导致的翼尖特征崩溃问题。

Method: 提出阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)，通过学习的共享旋转生成全局一致的参考点(阴影)，将局部RI描述符与全局姿态信息结合；设计旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)集成SiPF到特征聚合过程；基于Bingham分布的任务自适应阴影定位模块动态学习最优全局旋转。

Result: 在3D分类和部件分割基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有RI方法，特别是在需要细粒度空间区分能力的任意旋转任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过阴影信息姿态特征和旋转不变注意力卷积，成功解决了旋转不变学习中的全局姿态信息丢失问题，显著提升了模型在区分结构相似组件方面的能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种非对称跨模态知识蒸馏（ACKD）方法SemBridge，用于解决弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识传递问题，通过学生友好匹配模块和语义感知知识对齐模块提升知识传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中配对模态数据有限，对称跨模态知识蒸馏（SCKD）应用受限。本文旨在研究弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识蒸馏，以连接语义重叠有限的模态。

Method: 提出SemBridge框架，包含学生友好匹配模块（利用自监督学习获取语义知识并动态选择相关教师样本）和语义感知知识对齐模块（采用拉格朗日优化寻找最优传输路径）。

Result: 在遥感场景分类任务上，基于多光谱和RGB图像构建的基准数据集上，与7种现有方法在6种不同模型架构上的对比实验表明，该框架达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SemBridge框架有效解决了弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识蒸馏问题，在多种数据集和模型架构上均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合视觉预测与LLM结构先验的半监督文档布局理解框架，通过概率加权提升检测性能，在少量标注数据下实现优异效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档布局理解仍然需要大量标注数据，尽管半监督学习有所进展。需要一种方法能够有效利用未标注文档的结构信息。

Method: 使用OCR-LLM流水线推断层次化区域，通过逆方差融合将教师检测器输出与LLM结构先验结合，生成精炼的伪标签。

Result: 在轻量级SwiftFormer骨干上仅用5%标注达到88.2±0.3 AP；在LayoutLMv3上达到89.7±0.4 AP，超越标准半监督学习并匹配需要大规模预训练的UDOP。

Conclusion: LLM结构先验与轻量级和预训练架构具有互补性，学习到的实例自适应门控优于固定权重，开源LLM可实现隐私保护部署。

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Motivation: 解决CNN目标检测的形状依赖性缺陷，特别是在训练数据未包含的姿势下性能下降的问题，为灾难救援等形状不可预测场景提供可行方案。

Method: 利用服装的光谱反射特性，在无GPU的资源受限边缘设备上实现形状无关的人员检测系统。

Result: 处理速度达23.2fps（253x190像素），在模拟搜救场景中平均精度达93.5%，远超CNN模型的最佳53.8%，且误报率极低。

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam不是CNN检测器的替代品，而是在特定条件下（如形状不可预测的灾难救援场景）的补充工具，证明了基于光谱的人员检测在边缘设备实时操作的可行性。

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为负实体抑制（NES）的新方法，用于解决零样本图像描述中的幻觉问题。该方法通过合成图像、过滤负实体和注意力级抑制三个步骤，有效减少了跨域泛化时的幻觉现象。

Motivation: 文本训练方法在零样本图像描述中面临跨域泛化差和幻觉问题，检索方法可能加剧幻觉。需要一种能够抑制负实体（生成描述中出现但输入图像中不存在的对象）的方法。

Method: 提出负实体抑制（NES）方法，包含三个阶段：使用合成图像确保训练和推理时图像到文本检索的一致性；从检索内容中过滤负实体以提高准确性；使用识别出的负实体进行注意力级抑制，减少幻觉倾向特征的影响。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NES在保持竞争性域内性能的同时，提高了跨域迁移能力并降低了幻觉率，在零样本图像描述中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: NES方法有效解决了零样本图像描述中的幻觉问题，通过抑制负实体实现了更好的跨域泛化性能，为文本训练方法提供了实用的改进方案。

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SPEED-Q.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人机协同压缩方法主要基于人类视觉压缩流程，在整合机器视觉压缩时存在复杂度和比特率不足的问题。机器视觉仅关注图像/视频的核心区域，所需信息远少于人类视觉压缩信息。

Method: 提出基于机器视觉导向压缩的新型协同压缩方法，开发即插即用可变比特率策略，逐步聚合机器视觉压缩的语义信息，同时无缝利用扩散先验恢复人类视觉的高保真细节。

Conclusion: 该方法首次成功实现了以机器视觉为基础的人机协同压缩，为同时服务于人类感知和机器智能的图像/视频数据压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的推理延迟是其实时应用的关键障碍。现有轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏方法存在根本性权衡：轨迹蒸馏保留全局结构但牺牲高频细节，分布蒸馏可实现更高保真度但存在模式崩溃和训练不稳定问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为高保真单步扩散模型建立了一个稳健的新范式，通过协同利用轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏的优势，克服了各自方法的局限性。

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双向参考帧协调视频压缩方法BRHVC，通过双向运动收敛和双向上下文融合技术，优化双向参考帧的利用，在HEVC数据集上超越了传统编码方法VTM-RA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩相比P帧压缩研究较少，但其可以利用双向参考帧获得更好的压缩性能。然而分层编码可能导致连续时间预测复杂化，特别是在帧跨度较大的层级，使得两个参考帧的贡献不平衡。

Method: 提出BRHVC方法，包含双向运动收敛(BMC)和双向上下文融合(BCF)。BMC在运动压缩中收敛多个光流，实现更大尺度的精确运动补偿；BCF在运动补偿精度指导下显式建模参考上下文的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明，BRHVC优于之前最先进的神经视频压缩方法，甚至在HEVC数据集上超越了传统编码VTM-RA（随机访问配置）。

Conclusion: 通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，BRHVC能够有效协调双向参考帧，显著提升视频压缩性能。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Motivation: 分形生成模型(FGM)虽然能高效生成高质量图像，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出图像的多样性。为了解决这个问题，本文引入Hausdorff维度来量化结构复杂性，以增强生成输出的多样性。

Method: 1) 提出可学习的HD估计方法，直接从图像嵌入预测HD；2) 在训练阶段采用基于HD的损失函数和单调动量驱动的调度策略；3) 在推理阶段使用HD引导的拒绝采样来选择几何更丰富的输出。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，FGM-HD框架相比原始FGM实现了39%的输出多样性提升，同时保持了可比的图像质量。

Conclusion: 这是首个将HD引入FGM的工作，不仅有效增强了生成输出的多样性，还为FGM发展提供了理论贡献。

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无纸化工作流程的普及，签名从传统纸质转向电子格式。静态扫描签名虽然方便但几乎失去了认证属性，无法可靠验证且易被恶意复制和重用。

Method: 利用人类视觉系统对细微风格变化不敏感的特性，在生成过程中精细调节风格嵌入来隐式编码水印位，实现"一次签名，一次使用"策略。引入关键点驱动的数据增强策略来增强风格多样性，支持鲁棒的水印嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示，AuthSig在数字域失真和签名特定退化下提取准确率超过98%，在打印扫描场景下仍保持有效。

Conclusion: AuthSig成功解决了静态电子签名的安全认证问题，通过水印技术实现了可靠的签名验证和防复制保护。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比现有策略显著提升了ICL性能。

Conclusion: CoDR框架为有效且高效的演示选择提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Result: 在IDRiD和e-ophtha MA数据集上的综合实验表明，WDT-MD在像素级和图像级微动脉瘤检测方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: WDT-MD框架显著提升了微动脉瘤检测性能，对改善早期糖尿病视网膜病变筛查具有重要前景。

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

TL;DR: T-Rex-Omni是一个新颖的开放集目标检测框架，通过引入负视觉提示来抑制视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物，解决了现有方法仅依赖正提示的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开放集目标检测器仅依赖基于文本描述或视觉示例的正提示，在面对视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物时表现脆弱。需要引入负提示来提升模型的判别能力。

Method: 提出统一的视觉提示编码器联合处理正负视觉提示；设计无需训练的反向负计算模块动态抑制负响应；开发负提示铰链损失通过微调增强正负嵌入的判别边界。

Result: 在零样本检测任务中表现出色，显著缩小了视觉提示与文本提示方法之间的性能差距，在长尾场景下表现尤为突出（LVIS-minival上达到51.2 AP_r）。

Conclusion: 负提示是推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度，T-Rex-Omni框架支持灵活的正负推理模式部署，为开放集检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型中的对象幻觉问题，现有方法独立调节视觉或文本注意力，忽视了它们作为两个关键因果因素的交互作用。

Method: 提出VTACR指标量化模态贡献不平衡，设计细粒度注意力干预机制动态调整token和layer级注意力，采用双路径对比解码策略：一条路径强调视觉基础预测，另一条放大幻觉预测。

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR基准测试中，Owl实现了显著的幻觉减少，在保持视觉语言理解能力的同时，在忠实性方面达到了新的SOTA水平。

Conclusion: Owl通过建模幻觉的因果过程并动态调整模态注意力，有效缓解了对象幻觉问题，同时保持了模型的视觉语言理解能力。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Abstract: Existing unsupervised image alignment methods exhibit limited accuracy and high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a dense cross-scale image alignment model. It takes into account the correlations between cross-scale features to decrease the alignment difficulty. Our model supports flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency by adjusting the number of scales utilized. Additionally, we introduce a fully spatial correlation module to further improve accuracy while maintaining low computational costs. We incorporate the just noticeable difference to encourage our model to focus on image regions more sensitive to distortions, eliminating noticeable alignment errors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长视野一致性，而现有世界模型往往局限于特定领域，难以泛化到多样化环境和交互格式。

Method: 采用生成潜在预测(GLP)架构，结合基于大语言模型的自回归潜在动态骨干（支持语言指定动作）和视频扩散解码器（重建感知细节和时间连贯的视觉观察）。

Result: 在大规模视频-动作对数据集上训练，PAN在动作条件世界模拟、长视野预测和模拟推理方面表现优异，优于其他视频生成器和世界模型。

Conclusion: PAN朝着通用世界模型迈出了一步，能够为推理和行动提供未来世界状态的预测模拟。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Conclusion: 增强对抗攻击的多样性和覆盖范围对于提高测试时防御的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，DOC方法通过扩展对抗攻击空间和增加扰动多样性，能够发现更具泛化性的对抗攻击，有效中和对抗扰动。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: DKDS数据集填补了Kuzushiji识别在噪声环境下的研究空白，为相关任务提供了新的基准。

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average.

Conclusion: DBINDS通过分析潜在空间动态而非像素特征，有效解决了AI生成视频检测中的跨生成器泛化问题，为内容安全和取证分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Conclusion: 该框架能够可靠地测量不同多模态LLM的诊断能力和可信度，为临床部署提供可重现、可扩展的评估。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: TACO框架有效增强了多模态大语言模型的忠实性，证明了其在缓解幻觉问题方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出RichKD方法，通过融合传统教师模型和CLIP的视觉-语言知识来增强多教师知识蒸馏，利用多提示文本指导提升知识多样性和蒸馏质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，缺乏知识多样性，忽视了跨模态表示的潜力。CLIP的视觉-语言知识作为补充监督源在知识蒸馏中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出简单有效的框架，将传统教师的logits和特征与CLIP的logits和特征进行融合，结合CLIP的多提示文本指导，捕获数据集特定和语义丰富的视觉线索。

Result: 融合教师产生更自信可靠的预测，显著增加自信正确案例，减少自信错误案例。与CLIP融合优化了整个logit分布，为非常规类别生成语义有意义的概率，提高了类间一致性和蒸馏质量。

Conclusion: 尽管方法简单，但RichKD在多个基准测试中持续优于现有基线方法，并在分布偏移和输入损坏条件下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FQ-PETR是一个针对PETR系列3D检测模型的全量化框架，通过量化友好的位置嵌入、双查找表和非线性算子优化，在W8A8量化下实现接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降）和75%延迟降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PETR系列模型在3D检测基准上表现出色，但面临高计算成本和内存占用的部署挑战。现有量化方法直接应用于PETR会导致严重的精度下降，主要由于多模态特征间的显著幅度差异和非线性算子量化效率低的问题。

Method: 提出三个关键技术：1）量化友好的LiDAR射线位置嵌入，用单点采样替换多点采样；2）双查找表算法，用两个级联线性查找表近似复杂非线性函数；3）数值稳定化后量化，在softmax数值稳定化后执行量化以减少注意力失真。

Result: 在PETR系列模型上，FQ-PETR在W8A8量化下实现了接近浮点精度的性能（仅1%下降），同时将延迟降低了75%，显著优于现有的PTQ和QAT基线方法。

Conclusion: FQ-PETR成功解决了PETR系列模型量化中的关键挑战，为相机多视图3D检测模型的高效部署提供了有效的全量化解决方案。

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Conclusion: Flora方法通过创新的语义调整和分布感知分类器设计，显著提升了零样本骨架动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

Conclusion: 该框架通过迭代视觉优化实现鲁棒的域不变定位，新基准为基于视觉的支气管镜导航标准化进展提供了基础。

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法主要依赖几何线索并独立预测每帧姿态，无法有效处理模糊动作和泛化到真实场景。受人类理解和预测运动方式的启发，需要结合动作感知推理和时间想象力。

Method: 提出DreamPose3D框架：1）使用从2D姿态序列提取的任务相关动作提示动态调节去噪过程；2）引入表示编码器，在注意力机制中融入运动学关节亲和力；3）训练期间使用幻觉姿态解码器预测时间一致的3D姿态序列。

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作感知推理、时间想象力和结构关节关系建模，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在处理模糊和复杂运动场景时表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

TL;DR: GMTRouter是一个基于异质图学习的个性化LLM路由框架，通过四类节点表示用户-LLM交互，利用消息传递机制从少量数据中学习用户偏好，实现高效个性化路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法未能充分个性化，且难以捕捉用户与LLM之间的复杂交互关系。用户偏好数据通常稀缺、噪声大且格式不一致，限制了仅依赖用户特定数据的方法效果。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互表示为包含用户、LLM、查询和响应四类节点的异质图，通过定制的消息传递机制在轻量级归纳图学习框架中从少量数据中学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上，GMTRouter始终优于强基线方法，准确率提高0.9%至21.6%，AUC提高0.006至0.309。更重要的是，GMTRouter仅需少量数据即可适应新用户和演化偏好，无需大量微调。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过异质图表示和消息传递机制有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，在数据稀缺情况下仍能实现高质量的路由决策，具有良好的适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

Method: 从Reddit收集真实人类对话，使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o在同一话题上生成人工对话，通过并排展示给研究参与者进行识别测试。

Result: LLM生成的对话被误认为人类创作内容的概率为39%，特别是Llama 3生成的对话被正确识别为AI生成的概率仅为56%，几乎与随机猜测相当。

Conclusion: LLMs能够生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话来欺骗人类读者，这既显示了社交模拟的潜力，也警示了LLMs可能被滥用于生成虚假社交媒体内容的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

*Abha Jha,Abel Salinas,Fred Morstatter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在法律框架解释中的双重性：既能分析生物武器相关法律，又存在生成不安全输出的漏洞。通过知识图谱和RAG方法评估LLMs的法律理解能力和安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂法律框架解释方面具有变革潜力，但同时也存在生成危险内容的安全漏洞，特别是在生物武器等敏感领域。需要系统评估其法律理解能力和安全机制。

Method: 提出结合知识图谱构建和检索增强生成（RAG）的方法论，通过结构化实验评估LLMs的法律理解、法律意图判断能力以及不安全应用潜力。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在推理和安全机制方面存在显著局限性，但通过增强安全协议和更强大的法律推理框架可以改善。

Conclusion: 通过结合增强的安全协议和更强大的法律推理框架，本研究为开发能够在敏感法律领域提供道德和安全协助的LLMs奠定了基础，确保它们成为法律的保护者而非无意中的违反者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

*Stewart Slocum,Asher Parker-Sartori,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Soft Preference Learning方法来解决LLM对齐算法（如RLHF和DPO）导致的输出多样性下降问题，通过解耦KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，实现对LLM生成多样性的精细控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM对社会影响日益重要，但研究发现对齐算法显著降低了LLM输出的多样性，导致文本结构重复、问题解决方式单一、社会视角范围变窄。这主要是由于偏好学习算法中的KL散度正则化导致模型系统性地过加权多数意见。

Method: 提出Soft Preference Learning方法，解耦KL惩罚中的熵和交叉熵项，从而实现对LLM生成多样性的精细控制。该方法类似于但优于标准温度缩放。

Result: 从能力角度看，使用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLM在困难重复采样任务上获得更高准确率，产生具有更大语义和词汇多样性的输出。从对齐角度看，它们能够代表更广泛的社会观点并显示改进的对数校准。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning是对现有偏好学习算法的改进，能够有效解决对齐算法导致的多样性损失问题，在保持准确性的同时提升输出的多样性。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个框架来测试大型语言模型在对抗性提示下的真实性保真度，通过让模型生成并验证真假陈述，然后测试其对这些自生成谎言的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题是LLMs在关键领域实际部署面临的主要挑战，需要测试模型在对抗性提示下的真实性保真度。

Method: 三步骤框架：1) 让LLM生成与特定封闭领域一致的真假陈述；2) 让LLM验证这些陈述的真假；3) 测试LLM对自生成谎言的抵抗力。

Result: 在电影和小说两个封闭领域对5个主流专有LLMs的评估显示：Claude表现出强韧性，GPT和Grok中等韧性，Gemini和DeepSeek弱韧性。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多的人使用LLMs进行信息检索，研究结果敲响了警钟，表明不同模型对对抗性提示的抵抗力存在显著差异。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出Self-HarmLLM攻击场景，利用模型自身生成的模糊有害查询作为新输入来绕过防护机制，在多种条件下实现了高达65%的转换成功率和41%的越狱成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制假设攻击者来自外部，但未充分探索模型自身输出成为新攻击向量的可能性。

Method: 使用同一模型生成的模糊有害查询作为新输入，在GPT-3.5-turbo、LLaMA3-8B-instruct和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B上进行Base、Zero-shot和Few-shot实验。

Result: Zero-shot条件下转换成功率最高52%，越狱成功率最高33%；Few-shot条件下转换成功率最高65%，越狱成功率最高41%。自动化评估平均高估越狱成功率52%。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑防护机制设计并建立更鲁棒的评估方法，自动化评估单独使用不准确。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

Motivation: 解决孟加拉国低收入人群因法律语言复杂、程序不透明和成本高昂而难以获得负担得起的法律咨询的问题。

Method: 采用多语言嵌入和基于RAG的工具链框架，实现检索、推理、翻译和文档生成功能，通过交互式聊天界面提供法律草案、引用和平实语言解释。

Result: 在2022和2023年孟加拉国律师委员会考试中，Mina在初步选择题、笔试和模拟口试中得分75-80%，匹配或超过人类平均水平，表现出清晰度、上下文理解和合理法律推理能力。

Conclusion: Mina证明了其作为低成本多语言AI助手的潜力，可自动化关键法律任务并扩大司法可及性，为构建领域特定、低资源系统提供了实际案例研究。

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个结合检索增强生成(RAG)和领域知识库的系统，用于自动生成儿科言语语言病理学临床案例材料，解决了传统手动创建耗时且通用大语言模型缺乏专业知识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床案例是言语语言病理学教育的重要工具，但手动创建耗时且通用大语言模型缺乏领域专业知识，容易产生幻觉内容，需要大量专家修订。

Method: 构建了多模型RAG系统原型，整合了精选领域知识与工程化提示模板，支持5个商业和开源LLM，设计了7个涵盖不同障碍类型和年级水平的测试场景。

Result: 概念验证表明RAG增强生成儿科SLP案例在技术上是可行的。商业模型显示出边际质量优势，但开源替代方案达到了可接受的性能，表明具有隐私保护机构部署的潜力。

Conclusion: 整合精选知识库能够生成符合专业指南的内容，但需要通过专家评审、学生试点测试和心理测量评估进行广泛验证，未来应用可扩展到临床决策支持、自动IEP目标生成和临床反思培训。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了DisCoCirc形式主义到孟加拉语，应用于英孟翻译任务，发现该框架在减少语言官僚主义方面存在局限，特别是在处理语言结构差异时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展DisCoCirc形式主义到孟加拉语，重新评估其在减少语言官僚主义方面的有效性，并检验其在英孟翻译任务中的实际表现。

Method: 基于DisCoCirc的语法框架，开发孟加拉语版本，应用于英孟翻译任务，分析框架在处理语言结构差异时的局限性。

Result: 发现DisCoCirc虽然对大部分语言有效，但由于两种语言的结构差异，在翻译任务中仍面临限制，即使处理简单句子也存在困难。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc框架在翻译应用中存在约束，与先前声称的效果存在分歧，这突显了框架的局限性并为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

Method: 提出GrADS方法，设计自引导标准，利用梯度的大小和统计分布来优先选择对模型学习过程贡献最大的样本，从而获得能够增强LLMs对领域特定任务理解的代表性样本。

Result: 在医学、法律和金融等多个领域的各种LLMs上进行广泛实验，GrADS显示出显著的效率和成本效益。仅使用5%的GrADS选择数据，LLMs性能已超过全数据集微调，使用50%数据可获得显著改进，同时灾难性遗忘问题得到大幅缓解。

Conclusion: GrADS方法通过梯度感知的数据选择，有效解决了监督微调中的资源密集和灾难性遗忘问题，在多个专业领域验证了其高效性和成本效益。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了三种NLP模型，用于从帕金森病患者的第一人称叙述中自动识别反映认知过程的七个类别。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型表现最佳，在思想和社会互动等上下文依赖类别中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解帕金森病患者如何描述日常生活中的认知体验可以为疾病相关的认知和情感变化提供宝贵见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种模型家族：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的跨度分类模型用于嵌套实体识别、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型用于指令跟随、以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini。

Result: 模型性能在不同类别和模型家族间差异显著。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得最高总体F1分数（微观平均0.74，宏观平均0.59），在上下文依赖类别中表现优异。Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 与传统信息提取任务相比，由于复杂认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠性质，该任务更具挑战性。但经过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现低负担的纵向认知功能监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的宝贵补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Conclusion: BNLI为推进孟加拉语和其他低资源语言推理任务研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

TL;DR: HalluClean是一个轻量级、任务无关的框架，用于检测和修正大语言模型生成文本中的幻觉内容，通过规划-执行-修订的三阶段推理增强范式，在零样本设置下提升事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但经常产生幻觉内容，影响事实可靠性。为了解决这一问题，需要开发能够检测和修正幻觉的框架。

Method: HalluClean采用推理增强范式，将过程分解为规划、执行和修订三个阶段，使用最小任务路由提示实现零样本泛化，不依赖外部知识源或监督检测器。

Result: 在五个代表性任务（问答、对话、摘要、数学应用题和矛盾检测）上的实验结果表明，HalluClean显著提高了事实一致性，并优于竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: HalluClean展示了在现实应用中增强大语言模型输出可信度的潜力，为提升LLM生成内容的可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TiDAR是一种序列级混合架构，在单个前向传播中并行生成草稿token（扩散过程）并自回归采样最终输出，实现了高吞吐量和AR级别质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散语言模型并行生成优势与自回归模型质量优势之间的矛盾，寻求在保持高质量的同时实现高吞吐量和高GPU利用率。

Method: 使用结构化注意力掩码设计，在单个前向传播中同时进行扩散草稿生成（Thinking）和自回归采样（Talking），支持精确KV缓存。

Result: 在1.5B和8B规模上评估，TiDAR在吞吐量上超越推测解码，在效率和质量上超越Dream和Llada等扩散模型，首次在保持AR级别质量的同时实现4.71-5.91倍的每秒token生成量。

Conclusion: TiDAR成功弥合了扩散模型与自回归模型之间的质量差距，同时实现了显著的速度提升，为高效高质量语言生成提供了新的架构解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

TL;DR: 提出EVADE框架，使用大语言模型生成和验证解释来检测自然语言推理任务中的标注错误，相比传统人工两轮标注方法更高效且能提升数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言推理等任务中，人类标注变异使得难以区分标注错误与合理变异，传统VARIERR框架需要两轮人工标注，成本高且覆盖范围有限。

Method: 提出EVADE框架，利用大语言模型生成和验证解释来检测错误，通过分布比较、验证重叠和模型微调影响三个维度对比人工与LLM检测的错误。

Result: LLM验证使生成的解释分布更接近人工标注，从训练数据中移除LLM检测的错误比移除人工检测的错误在微调性能上提升更明显。

Conclusion: LLM能够扩展错误检测规模，在减少人工努力的同时改善标注变异下的数据集质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

Method: 引入SpiralThinker框架，执行潜在表示的迭代更新，实现无需生成额外token的扩展隐式推理。采用渐进对齐目标结合结构化注释来维持潜在推理和文本推理之间的一致性。

Result: 在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中，SpiralThinker在所有基准测试中始终超越先前方法，实现了潜在推理方法中的最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: SpiralThinker将迭代计算与潜在推理相结合，证明对齐的迭代更新可以在潜在空间中可靠地引导推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于轨迹的情感支持评估框架，从静态对话评估转向动态长期评估，通过模拟328个情感情境和1152个干扰事件来测试大语言模型改善用户情绪状态的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型情感支持评估主要依赖短时静态对话，无法捕捉情感支持的动态性和长期性，需要更全面的评估方法来衡量模型在长期交互中改善用户情绪的能力。

Method: 采用用户中心视角，构建大规模基准测试，约束模型输出使用经过验证的情绪调节策略，将用户情感轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，并应用因果调整的情绪估计来获得无偏的情感状态跟踪。

Result: 提出了三个轨迹级指标（BEL、ETV、ECP）来捕捉用户情感动态，并在多样化的大语言模型上进行了广泛评估，揭示了情感支持能力的显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架为长期情感支持性能提供了全面评估方法，为模型开发提供了可操作的见解，证明了从快照评估转向轨迹评估的重要性。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了上下文截断问题，适应不同语速，在保持接近全局解码性能的同时显著提升了安多藏语流式语音识别的准确性和效率。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Conclusion: Bi-RAR通过双向评估中间步骤和强化学习优化，显著提升了检索增强生成在多步推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri系统评估大语言模型的幽默能力，发现LLMs在生成幽默回复方面达到中低水平人类表现，但在共情能力上存在明显缺陷，且与人类在幽默评估标准上存在根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常使用单一维度（如是否"有趣"）来评估大语言模型的幽默能力，本文认为需要多维度理解幽默，因此通过Oogiri游戏进行系统评估。

Method: 扩展现有Oogiri数据集，用LLMs生成回复，然后人工标注六个维度（新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智能性、共情性、整体趣味性）的5分绝对评分，评估LLMs在生成和评估两个核心任务上的表现。

Result: LLMs能生成达到中低水平人类表现的幽默回复，但共情能力明显不足；相关性分析显示LLMs优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑共情性，这解释了LLMs无法复制人类幽默评估的原因。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默生成方面有一定能力，但在共情方面存在缺陷，与人类的幽默评估标准存在根本差异；发布标注语料库以促进开发更具情感智能的对话系统。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Motivation: Transformer模型中的旋转位置嵌入(RoPE)存在固有局限性，削弱了长度外推能力。作者旨在解决注意力下沉现象，改善长上下文处理性能。

Method: DoPE方法基于截断矩阵熵检测特征图中的异常频率带，利用噪声特性通过参数自由的高斯分布重新参数化特征图，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 对位置嵌入的去噪策略有效缓解了注意力下沉并恢复了平衡的注意力模式，为改善长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

Conclusion: 闭环自精炼数据管道可以显著增强LLM的工具使用能力，证明了在成本效益高的开源生态系统中实现完全自动化模型感知数据进化的可行性。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Method: 使用混合检索机制（语言模型和TF-IDF）计算给定问题与单个单元格的相似度来估计表头，然后在最相关行和列的交叉点选择单元格作为答案。语言模型通过对比学习在问题-表头对的小数据集上进行训练。

Result: 在NTCIR-18的TQA数据集上评估，该方法准确率达到74.6%，优于GPT-4o mini的63.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在表格问答任务中表现优于现有LLM，未来计划整合更高效的文本搜索模型来进一步提高性能并缩小与人工评估结果的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

### [80] [Context is Enough: Empirical Validation of $\textit{Sequentiality}$ on Essays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09185)
*Amal Sunny,Advay Gupta,Vishnu Sreekumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过实证验证了基于上下文的sequentiality度量比原始版本更符合人类对文章流畅性的评估，在结合标准语言特征时能提供更好的预测效果，甚至优于零样本LLM预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对之前研究中sequentiality度量存在主题选择混淆问题且缺乏真实流畅度验证的批评，本文旨在实证验证仅使用上下文术语作为更有效和可解释的替代方案。

Method: 使用两个带有人工标注特征分数的论文数据集（ASAP++和ELLIPSE），比较不同版本的sequentiality度量与人类对组织性和连贯性等话语层面特征的评估一致性。

Result: 基于上下文的sequentiality版本与人类对组织性和连贯性的评估更一致；虽然零样本LLM在预测特征分数方面更准确，但上下文度量与标准语言特征结合时比主题版本和原始sequentiality提供更多预测价值，且优于零样本LLM预测。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为经过验证、可解释且互补的特征，用于自动论文评分和相关NLP任务。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

*Francois Meyer,Jan Buys*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了子词分割在训练过程中的学习动态，通过扩展子词分段语言模型来支持预训练和微调，分析了三种不同形态类型语言的子词演化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的子词分割通常在预处理阶段固定，本文探索在训练过程中动态优化子词分割的可行性，研究子词在预训练和微调过程中的演化规律。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型（SSLM）框架，支持预训练和微调，在三种形态类型不同的语言（isi-Xhosa、Setswana、英语）上进行训练，从语言学角度分析子词动态。

Result: 识别了子词学习的四个阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调过程中子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习的子词能改善低资源、形态复杂语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 可学习的子词分割为低资源、形态复杂语言提供了有前景的改进方法，子词在训练过程中会动态演化，特别是在微调阶段边界会变得更加精细。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言模型在可验证奖励强化学习（RLVR）中的诚实对齐问题，特别关注演绎推理任务。作者发现现有方法在训练早期容易崩溃，提出了Anchor方法通过注入真实轨迹来稳定训练，显著提升了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法主要优化最终任务结果，在早期训练中负奖励占主导时容易崩溃。这在诚实对齐任务中尤其明显，模型不仅要解决可回答的查询，还要识别何时无法从给定前提得出结论。演绎推理提供了理想的测试平台，因为它将推理能力与对外部事实知识的依赖分离开来。

Method: 作者从图结构中策划了两个多步演绎推理数据集（线性代数和逻辑推理），通过随机扰动边来引入不可回答的情况。他们评估了稳定策略，发现课程学习有一定帮助但需要精心设计的数据集。为此提出了Anchor方法，在rollout中注入真实轨迹以防止早期训练崩溃。

Result: 实验表明GRPO方法（无论是否有监督微调初始化）在这些任务上表现不佳。Anchor方法显著稳定了学习过程，并大幅提升了整体推理性能。在三个模型上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 训练动态对于在已对齐语言模型中实现可靠的演绎推理至关重要。Anchor方法通过注入真实轨迹有效解决了早期训练崩溃问题，为诚实对齐提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

TL;DR: POTSA框架通过交叉语言平行语音对和最优传输技术，解决语音大语言模型在多语言语音到文本翻译中的语义偏差问题，显著提升了高资源和低资源语言之间的翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型在多语言语音到文本翻译中忽视了跨语言语义共性，导致翻译性能存在偏差，特别是在高资源和低资源语言之间存在显著差距。

Method: 提出POTSA框架：1）偏差补偿模块粗粒度对齐初始语音表示；2）在Q-Former上施加基于平行语音对的token级最优传输约束，建立细粒度表示一致性；3）采用层调度策略将OT约束聚焦于最具语义益处的层。

Result: 在FLEURS数据集上的实验表明，该方法仅使用每种源语言10小时的平行语音数据，就在五种常见语言上平均提升+0.93 BLEU，在零样本语言上提升+5.05 BLEU，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: POTSA框架通过最优传输技术有效弥合了高资源和低资源语言之间的翻译差距，显著提升了多语言语音到文本翻译的性能。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

TL;DR: C³TG是一个用于细粒度、多维度文本属性控制的两阶段框架，通过生成阶段和优化阶段实现多属性协调控制，无需修改模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以实现精确的多属性控制，在属性冲突时缺乏协调机制，且无法在控制生成流程中融入迭代优化过程。

Method: 两阶段框架：生成阶段使用属性分类器和加权KL散度调整token概率；优化阶段通过能量函数结合分类器分数和惩罚项，通过迭代反馈解决属性冲突。

Result: 实验表明C³TG在属性准确性、语言流畅性、输出多样性和降低毒性等多个指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: C³TG是无需昂贵模型修改的有效灵活的多维度文本属性控制解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了LiteraryTaste数据集，包含60人的阅读偏好数据，用于开发个性化创意写作大语言模型。研究发现人们创意写作偏好存在差异，微调Transformer编码器可有效建模个人和集体偏好，但自述偏好在建模实际偏好方面作用有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们有不同的创意写作偏好，但现有大语言模型通常将不同个人品味视为整体进行训练。为了开发个性化创意写作LLMs，需要理解用户的具体偏好。

Method: 构建LiteraryTaste数据集，包含60人的阅读习惯自述和100对短创意写作文本的偏好标注；使用Transformer编码器进行微调来建模偏好；采用LLM驱动的可解释性管道分析偏好变化。

Result: 1) 人们在创意写作偏好上存在显著差异；2) 微调Transformer编码器在建模个人和集体实际偏好时分别达到75.8%和67.7%的准确率；3) 自述偏好在建模实际偏好方面效用有限。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化创意写作技术奠定了基础，强调了理解用户实际偏好的重要性，而不仅仅是依赖其自述偏好。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

TL;DR: 本文提出了mmJEE-Eval多模态双语基准，基于印度JEE Advanced考试题目，评估发现前沿VLMs在复杂推理任务上表现优异但开源模型表现不佳，揭示了现有基准在区分真实科学推理能力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准无法充分区分真实科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更具挑战性的基准来评估模型的实际推理能力。

Method: 构建了包含1,460道JEE Advanced考试题目的多模态双语基准，涵盖物理、化学和数学领域，评估了17个最先进模型。

Result: 前沿VLMs在2025年题目上达到77-84%准确率，开源模型仅37-45%，当增加元认知推理负荷时GPT-5只能修正5.2%错误。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval能有效区分优秀训练和推理方法，其难度源于复杂性和推理深度而非记忆，为评估真实科学推理能力提供了新标准。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

Motivation: 测试时扩展虽然能提升LLM推理性能，但带来显著计算成本。现有动态自一致性方法受限于串行请求的高延迟问题。

Method: 利用快速系统1计算查询的答案熵来评估样本扩展潜力，在系统2下实现动态自一致性，通过并行生成降低延迟。

Result: 相比现有方法，SeerSC实现了47%令牌消耗减少和43%推理延迟降低，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC通过整合双系统推理有效解决了测试时扩展的效率和延迟问题，为LLM推理优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Motivation: 现有SPARQL到Cypher的转换工具存在解析错误率高的问题，需要开发更准确、轻量级的解析器来支持大规模查询转换。

Method: S2CLite采用纯基于规则的方法（受传统编程语言编译器启发），无需RDF图或外部工具，实现了SPARQL到Cypher的转换。

Result: 在BSBM42和Spider4SPARQL数据集上的实验显示，S2CLite显著减少了解析错误，解析准确率达到77.8%，执行准确率在交集查询子集上达到96.6%，优于S2CTrans 7.3%。

Conclusion: S2CLite是一个有效的SPARQL到Cypher转换工具，同时生成了统一的文本到查询语言数据集Spider4SSC，为多语言查询处理提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型(LLMs)在评估输出方面变得越来越有效和可扩展，但尚不清楚这种能力是否能够从特定任务评估扩展到更一般的文本质量评估，特别是在多语言环境中。

Method: 首先自动生成文本质量偏好数据，然后使用这些数据训练开源基础LLMs，使其与高质量和低质量文本的评分保持一致。

Result: 在115种语言上的综合评估表明，所提出的模型性能有所提升。进一步分析发现，这种增强的评估能力还能显著改善下游任务。

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval框架在多语言文本质量评估方面表现出色，其增强的评估能力对下游任务也有积极影响。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了AMaPO方法，通过自适应边距设计解决离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，在多个基准测试中实现了更好的排序准确性和下游对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线偏好优化虽然比RLHF更简单稳定，但其效果严重依赖排序准确性。当前方法存在过拟合-欠拟合困境：对正确排序样本应用过多梯度（过拟合），对错误排序样本提供不足的纠正信号（欠拟合）。

Method: 提出AMaPO算法，采用实例级自适应边距，通过Z-归一化和指数缩放进行优化，动态重新分配学习努力：放大错误排序样本的梯度，抑制正确排序样本的梯度。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO不仅实现了更好的排序准确性和下游对齐性能，而且针对性分析证实其成功缓解了核心的过拟合和欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边距设计有效解决了离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，为语言模型对齐提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个针对低资源语言巴斯克语的多模态大语言模型，通过创建训练和评估数据集，探索不同数据混合比例，发现仅需20%的巴斯克语多模态数据即可获得良好效果，且无需巴斯克语指令调优的骨干LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前商业多模态大语言模型在低资源语言上表现尚可，但开源社区尚未实现可比结果。本文旨在为低资源语言巴斯克语开发强大的多模态大语言模型。

Method: 创建了训练和评估用的图像-文本数据集，使用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克语适配变体Latxa作为骨干模型，探索了多种数据混合训练策略。

Result: 研究表明：i) 仅需约20%的巴斯克语多模态数据即可在巴斯克语基准测试中获得稳定结果；ii) 出乎意料的是，无需巴斯克语指令调优的骨干LLM也能构建强大的巴斯克语MLLM。

Conclusion: 本文结果为其他低资源语言开发多模态大语言模型铺平了道路，并通过公开释放资源促进相关研究。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

TL;DR: CARE-Bench是一个动态交互式自动化基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在心理咨询领域的专业能力，基于真实案例构建多样化客户档案，采用多维性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理咨询需求增长与有限服务供给之间的不匹配，促使研究将大语言模型应用于该领域，但现有评估方法存在客户模拟不专业、评估格式静态单一、指标单维等局限性。

Method: 基于真实心理咨询案例构建多样化客户档案，按照专家指南进行模拟，提供基于成熟心理量表的多维性能评估，并与心理学家合作分析模型失败原因。

Result: 评估了多个通用大语言模型和专业心理咨询模型，揭示了它们当前的局限性，并分析了不同类型客户互动中模型失败的具体原因。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更全面、通用和有效的心理咨询模型提供了方向，CARE-Bench能够更准确地评估模型处理复杂多样化客户的能力。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Motivation: 机器学习研究发展迅速，从科学出版物中提取信息能够大规模识别研究概念和资源信息，从而改善对ML相关研究的理解和可复现性。

Method: 引入GSAP-ERE数据集，这是一个手动整理的细粒度数据集，用于从ML出版物中提取和连接细粒度信息（如方法训练和数据使用）。

Result: 该数据集使微调模型能够自动提取下游任务相关信息，从知识图谱构建到大规模监控AI研究的计算可复现性。与最先进的LLM提示方法相比，微调模型性能显著更优（NER: 80.6% vs 44.4%，RE: 54.0% vs 10.1%）。

Conclusion: 监督模型与无监督LLM使用之间的性能差距表明，需要像GSAP-ERE这样的数据集来推进学术信息提取领域的研究。

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动化、可扩展的方法，用于在工业规模网表中生成硬件木马样模式，以在不改变用户可见功能的情况下对检测工具进行压力测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业SoC包含数十万到数百万个网表和数百万到数千万个连接边，使得在现实设计上对硬件木马检测器进行实证评估既必要又困难。公共基准测试仍然显著较小且手工制作，而发布真正的恶意RTL会带来道德和操作风险。

Method: 该流水线(i)将大型门级设计解析为连接图，(ii)使用SCOAP可测试性度量探索稀有区域，(iii)应用参数化、功能保持的图变换来合成触发-负载对，模拟隐蔽硬件木马的统计足迹。

Result: 在本工作生成的基准测试上评估时，代表性的最先进图学习模型无法检测到木马。

Conclusion: 该框架通过提供可重复的挑战实例，在不共享逐步攻击指令的情况下推进安全研究，从而缩小了学术电路与现代SoC之间的评估差距。

Abstract: Industrial Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) often comprise hundreds of thousands to millions of nets and millions to tens of millions of connectivity edges, making empirical evaluation of hardware-Trojan (HT) detectors on realistic designs both necessary and difficult. Public benchmarks remain significantly smaller and hand-crafted, while releasing truly malicious RTL raises ethical and operational risks. This work presents an automated and scalable methodology for generating HT-like patterns in industry-scale netlists whose purpose is to stress-test detection tools without altering user-visible functionality. The pipeline (i) parses large gate-level designs into connectivity graphs, (ii) explores rare regions using SCOAP testability metrics, and (iii) applies parameterized, function-preserving graph transformations to synthesize trigger-payload pairs that mimic the statistical footprint of stealthy HTs. When evaluated on the benchmarks generated in this work, representative state-of-the-art graph-learning models fail to detect Trojans. The framework closes the evaluation gap between academic circuits and modern SoCs by providing reproducible challenge instances that advance security research without sharing step-by-step attack instructions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的射频指纹提取技术，利用多天线信号解决多径问题而不增加延迟，通过计算共时信道频率响应的对数线性增量比来保持区分性特征，在30个用户设备的20路径信道中达到96.13%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G超低延迟通信对身份识别提出了严格的时序要求，现有加密方案会增加计算开销和识别延迟，而射频指纹识别虽然能减少延迟但受多径信道影响，现有抗多径方法需要反馈或多时间点处理，会带来额外信令延迟。

Method: 使用多接收天线的信号，计算共时信道频率响应的对数线性增量比来保持区分性射频指纹特征，将频带分割为子带并在每个子带内单独计算LLDR，避免多时间采样。

Result: 在20路径信道和20dB信噪比条件下，对30个用户设备达到96.13%的识别准确率，通过Roofline模型评估得到0.491ms的空口延迟，满足超可靠低延迟通信的延迟要求。

Conclusion: 所提出的射频指纹提取方案能够有效解决多径信道问题，在保持高识别准确率的同时显著降低延迟，满足5G URLLC应用的严格要求。

Abstract: Ultra-low latency, the hallmark of fifth-generation mobile communications (5G), imposes exacting timing demands on identification as well. Current cryptographic solutions introduce additional computational overhead, which results in heightened identification delays. Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identifies devices at the physical layer, blocking impersonation attacks while significantly reducing latency. Unfortunately, multipath channels compromise RFF accuracy, and existing channel-resilient methods demand feedback or processing across multiple time points, incurring extra signaling latency. To address this problem, the paper introduces a new RFF extraction technique that employs signals from multiple receiving antennas to address multipath issues without adding latency. Unlike single-domain methods, the Log-Linear Delta Ratio (LLDR) of co-temporal channel frequency responses (CFRs) from multiple antennas is employed to preserve discriminative RFF features, eliminating multi-time sampling and reducing acquisition time. To overcome the challenge of the reliance on minimal channel variation, the frequency band is segmented into sub-bands, and the LLDR is computed within each sub-band individually. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme attains a 96.13% identification accuracy for 30 user equipments (UEs) within a 20-path channel under a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB. Furthermore, we evaluate the theoretical latency using the Roofline model, resulting in the air interface latency of 0.491 ms, which satisfies ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) latency requirements.

TL;DR: iSeal是一种针对LLM知识产权保护的指纹方法，能够在攻击者完全控制模型推理过程的情况下进行可靠验证，通过模型和外部模块的双重特征注入以及纠错机制来抵抗验证时攻击。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型训练成本高昂，保护其知识产权变得至关重要。现有指纹方法在验证过程中容易受到攻击，当模型窃贼完全控制LLM推理过程时，这些方法会失效。

Method: iSeal通过在模型和外部模块中注入独特特征，结合纠错机制和基于相似度的验证策略，构建对验证时攻击具有抵抗力的指纹系统。

Result: 在12个LLM上对抗10多种攻击时，iSeal实现了100%的指纹成功率，而基线方法在遗忘和响应操纵攻击下均失败。

Conclusion: iSeal是首个能够在模型窃贼端到端控制可疑LLM时进行可靠验证的指纹方法，通过理论分析和实证结果证明了其对验证时攻击的抵抗力。

Abstract: Given the high cost of large language model (LLM) training from scratch, safeguarding LLM intellectual property (IP) has become increasingly crucial. As the standard paradigm for IP ownership verification, LLM fingerprinting thus plays a vital role in addressing this challenge. Existing LLM fingerprinting methods verify ownership by extracting or injecting model-specific features. However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner. It injects unique features into both the model and an external module, reinforced by an error-correction mechanism and a similarity-based verification strategy. These components are resistant to verification-time attacks, including collusion-based fingerprint unlearning and response manipulation, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. iSeal achieves 100 percent Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) on 12 LLMs against more than 10 attacks, while baselines fail under unlearning and response manipulations.

Abstract: Model watermarking techniques can embed watermark information into the protected model for ownership declaration by constructing specific input-output pairs. However, existing watermarks are easily removed when facing model stealing attacks, and make it difficult for model owners to effectively verify the copyright of stolen models. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of the failure of current watermarking methods under model stealing scenarios and then explore potential solutions. Specifically, we introduce a robust watermarking framework, DeepTracer, which leverages a novel watermark samples construction method and a same-class coupling loss constraint. DeepTracer can incur a high-coupling model between watermark task and primary task that makes adversaries inevitably learn the hidden watermark task when stealing the primary task functionality. Furthermore, we propose an effective watermark samples filtering mechanism that elaborately select watermark key samples used in model ownership verification to enhance the reliability of watermarks. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in defending against various model stealing attacks, as well as watermark attacks, and achieves new state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Healthcare federated learning requires strong privacy guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency across resource-constrained medical institutions. This paper presents MedHE, a novel framework combining adaptive gradient sparsification with CKKS homomorphic encryption to enable privacy-preserving collaborative learning on sensitive medical data. Our approach introduces a dynamic threshold mechanism with error compensation for top-k gradient selection, achieving 97.5 percent communication reduction while preserving model utility.

Abstract: Smart contracts concentrate high value assets and complex logic in small, immutable programs, where even minor bugs can cause major losses. Existing taxonomies and tools remain fragmented, organized around symptoms such as reentrancy rather than structural causes. This paper introduces an attack-centric, program-structure taxonomy that unifies Solidity vulnerabilities into eight root-cause families covering control flow, external calls, state integrity, arithmetic safety, environmental dependencies, access control, input validation, and cross-domain protocol assumptions. Each family is illustrated through concise Solidity examples, exploit mechanics, and mitigations, and linked to the detection signals observable by static, dynamic, and learning-based tools. We further cross-map legacy datasets (SmartBugs, SolidiFI) to this taxonomy to reveal label drift and coverage gaps. The taxonomy provides a consistent vocabulary and practical checklist that enable more interpretable detection, reproducible audits, and structured security education for both researchers and practitioners.

TL;DR: 提出SAE方法增强对抗样本在类增量学习(CIL)环境下的可持续性，通过语义校正和过滤增强模块使对抗样本语义更接近目标类并远离其他类，解决模型更新后对抗样本失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗样本主要针对静态模型设计，但在类增量学习场景中模型会不断更新，导致对抗样本因领域漂移而失效。需要开发可持续的对抗样本以适应动态变化的模型。

Method: 提出SAE方法，包含语义校正模块（利用视觉语言模型生成通用语义，结合CIL模型校正优化方向）和过滤增强模块（识别具有目标类语义的非目标样本并进行增强）。

Result: 在类别数量增加9倍的情况下，SAE比基线方法平均性能提升31.28%。

Conclusion: SAE通过增强对抗样本语义的鲁棒性，有效解决了类增量学习场景中对抗样本可持续性问题，显著提升了对抗样本在模型更新后的有效性。

Abstract: Current adversarial examples (AEs) are typically designed for static models. However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAE outperforms baselines by an average of 31.28% when updated with a 9-fold increase in the number of classes.

Abstract: Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a sub-discipline of Operations Research that helps decision-makers in choosing, ranking, or sorting alternatives based on conflicting criteria. Over time, its application has been expanded into dynamic and data-driven domains, such as recommender systems. In these contexts, the availability and handling of personal and sensitive data can play a critical role in the decision-making process. Despite this increased reliance on sensitive data, the integration of privacy mechanisms with MCDM methods is underdeveloped. This paper introduces an integrated approach that combines MCDM outranking methods with Differential Privacy (DP), safeguarding individual contributions' privacy in ranking problems. This approach relies on a pre-processing step to aggregate multiple user evaluations into a comprehensive performance matrix. The evaluation results show a strong to very strong statistical correlation between the true rankings and their anonymized counterparts, ensuring robust privacy parameter guarantees.

Result: 从37家区块链安全公司的1,419份审计报告中识别108个SRV案例，分类为5种类型；在15,383个涉及签名验证的合约中发现SRV广泛存在，影响476万美元活跃资产，以太坊上19.63%使用签名的合约包含SRV；LASiR检测F1分数达87.90%。

Conclusion: 签名重放漏洞在智能合约中普遍存在，LASiR结合LLM语义理解能显著提升检测性能，为智能合约安全提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Smart contracts have significantly advanced blockchain technology, and digital signatures are crucial for reliable verification of contract authority. Through signature verification, smart contracts can ensure that signers possess the required permissions, thus enhancing security and scalability. However, lacking checks on signature usage conditions can lead to repeated verifications, increasing the risk of permission abuse and threatening contract assets. We define this issue as the Signature Replay Vulnerability (SRV). In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the causes and characteristics of the SRVs. From 1,419 audit reports across 37 blockchain security companies, we identified 108 with detailed SRV descriptions and classified five types of SRVs. To detect these vulnerabilities automatically, we designed LASiR, which utilizes the general semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the static taint analysis of the signature state and identify the signature reuse behavior. It also employs path reachability verification via symbolic execution to ensure effective and reliable detection. To evaluate the performance of LASiR, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15,383 contracts involving signature verification, selected from the initial dataset of 918,964 contracts across four blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection. Ablation studies and comparative experiments reveal that the semantic information provided by LLMs aids static taint analysis, significantly enhancing LASiR's detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布式后门攻击通过将全局触发器分解为子触发器来提高隐蔽性，但这需要更多投毒数据来维持攻击强度，增加了暴露风险。为了克服这一缺陷，需要开发一种既能保持攻击强度又能减少投毒量的方法。

Method: 提出了FTDBA方法：1）利用分形自相似性增强子触发器特征强度；2）引入动态角度扰动机制，在训练阶段自适应调整扰动强度以平衡效率和隐蔽性。

Result: 实验结果显示：FTDBA仅需传统DBA方法62.4%的投毒量就能达到92.3%的攻击成功率，同时检测率降低22.8%，KL散度降低41.2%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种低暴露、高效率的联邦后门攻击范式，并拓展了分形特征在对抗样本生成中的应用。

Abstract: Traditional distributed backdoor attacks (DBA) in federated learning improve stealthiness by decomposing global triggers into sub-triggers, which however requires more poisoned data to maintian the attck strength and hence increases the exposure risk. To overcome this defect, This paper proposes a novel method, namely Fractal-Triggerred Distributed Backdoor Attack (FTDBA), which leverages the self-similarity of fractals to enhance the feature strength of sub-triggers and hence significantly reduce the required poisoning volume for the same attack strength. To address the detectability of fractal structures in the frequency and gradient domains, we introduce a dynamic angular perturbation mechanism that adaptively adjusts perturbation intensity across the training phases to balance efficiency and stealthiness. Experiments show that FTDBA achieves a 92.3\% attack success rate with only 62.4\% of the poisoning volume required by traditional DBA methods, while reducing the detection rate by 22.8\% and KL divergence by 41.2\%. This study presents a low-exposure, high-efficiency paradigm for federated backdoor attacks and expands the application of fractal features in adversarial sample generation.

### [107] [Quantum Meet-in-the-Middle Attacks on Key-Length Extension Constructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09351)
*Min Liang,Ruihao Gao,Jiali Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对两种密钥长度扩展构造的量子中间相遇攻击：对2kTE构造的两种Q2模型攻击（基于量子爪查找和Grover算法），以及对3XCE构造的Q1模型攻击。还扩展了量子筛子中间攻击框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究密钥长度扩展技术在量子计算模型下的安全性，评估现有KLE构造在量子攻击下的脆弱性。

Method: 使用量子中间相遇攻击技术，结合量子爪查找算法、Grover算法和量子筛子中间攻击框架，分析2kTE和3XCE构造的安全性。

Result: 对2kTE：QCF攻击时间复杂度O(2^{2κ/3})，Grover攻击O(2^{κ/2})；对3XCE：Q1攻击时间复杂度O(2^{(κ+n)/2})；提出了通用的量子SITM攻击框架。

Conclusion: 2kTE在Q2模型下安全性提升有限，3XCE在Q1模型下存在量子加速攻击，量子SITM框架可应用于更广泛的密码分析场景。

Abstract: Key-length extension (KLE) techniques provide a general approach to enhancing the security of block ciphers by using longer keys. There are mainly two classes of KLE techniques, cascade encryption and XOR-cascade encryption. This paper presents several quantum meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against two specific KLE constructions.
  For the two-key triple encryption (2kTE), we propose two quantum MITM attacks under the Q2 model. The first attack, leveraging the quantum claw-finding (QCF) algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{2κ/3})$ with $O(2^{2κ/3})$ quantum random access memory (QRAM). The second attack, based on Grover's algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{κ/2})$ with $O(2^κ)$ QRAM. The latter complexity is nearly identical to Grover-based brute-force attack on the underlying block cipher, indicating that 2kTE does not enhance security under the Q2 model when sufficient QRAM resources are available.
  For the 3XOR-cascade encryption (3XCE), we propose a quantum MITM attack applicable to the Q1 model. This attack requires no QRAM and has a time complexity of $O(2^{(κ+n)/2})$ ($κ$ and $n$ are the key length and block length of the underlying block cipher, respectively.), achieving a quadratic speedup over classical MITM attack.
  Furthermore, we extend the quantum MITM attack to quantum sieve-in-the-middle (SITM) attack, which is applicable for more constructions. We present a general quantum SITM framework for the construction $ELE=E^2\circ L\circ E^1$ and provide specific attack schemes for three different forms of the middle layer $L$. The quantum SITM attack technique can be further applied to a broader range of quantum cryptanalysis scenarios.

### [108] [Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715)
*Connar Hite,Sean Saud,Raef Taha,Nayim Rahman,Tanvir Atahary,Scott Douglass,Tarek Taha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用LLM和AMR图将无约束英语翻译成ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题，生成完整的ASP程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP是一种强大的组合问题解决工具，但需要学习语法。随着非编程人员与代码交互的需求增加，需要更易用的自然语言到ASP的转换方法。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后通过AMR图解析简化语言并系统生成ASP约束，最小化LLM的作用。

Result: 系统成功创建了完整的ASP程序来解决组合逻辑问题，展示了该方法的能力。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题解决系统的重要第一步。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Result: 在ARC-AGI-1-Train上得分10.8%，ARC-AGI-1-Eval上得分3.0%；在Sort-of-ARC上得分94.5%，1D-ARC上得分83.1%，后者以极小计算成本超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了最具认知合理性的ARC-AGI求解器，代码已开源。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法只能学习表面教学模式，缺乏动态适应能力；近期强化学习方法存在两个关键挑战：无法区分学生是否真正理解vs重复教师答案，以及无法实时感知学生认知状态变化来动态调整教学策略。

Method: UCO方法采用多轮交互式强化学习范式，包含两个协同奖励函数：进展奖励捕捉学生认知进步，评估学生是否真正从困惑转向理解；支架奖励动态识别每个学生的最近发展区，鼓励教师在此区域内保持有效教学。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试上与11个基线模型比较，UCO模型在同等规模模型中表现最优，性能可与先进的闭源模型相媲美。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过创新的奖励函数设计有效解决了LLM作为智能导师时的动态适应问题，在数学教育任务中展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型表现出优秀的流畅性，但研究者仍在努力提升其推理能力。本文基于搜索导向的LLM计算解释，提出了一个系统化框架来理解LLM推理和优化。

Method: 采用递归精炼方法，包括自我批评、对抗性压力测试和整合关键反馈的迭代过程。设计实验比较简单线性管道与包含递归精炼层的复杂结构化管道，使用基于RAG的美国开国元勋历史人物模型来回应当代政治议题。

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理能力的稳健架构特征。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列预测方法大多将其视为静态的一次性映射任务，缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应性，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性。

Method: 框架包含两个阶段：自动预测准备阶段构建多源认知基础（特征集、领域知识库、上下文存储库、案例库）；生成推理和反射优化阶段整合统计特征、先验知识、上下文信息和预测策略，触发元推理循环进行持续自校正和策略优化。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人类智慧与LLM智能的协同推理，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和实用性，为复杂现实环境中的预测任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Argus框架能够高效增强自动驾驶系统的韧性，显著改善驾驶性能并减少安全违规，为复杂驾驶场景中的安全运行提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Conclusion: OR-R1提供了一个稳健、可扩展且成本效益高的自动化运筹学优化问题建模和求解解决方案，显著降低了工业应用的专业和数据障碍。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1）经常生成包含冗余或无关推理步骤的冗长响应，这种现象被称为过度思考，显著增加了计算成本。现有的长度惩罚方法存在长度崩溃和训练崩溃的问题。

Result: 在五个数学基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在Qwen2.5-7B上实现了8.1%的准确率提升和19.9%的响应令牌长度减少，并且在Llama和Mistral等其他LLM上也能很好地泛化。

Conclusion: 该方法通过理论证明和实验验证，能够有效促进更有效和更高效的推理，同时提供了公开可用的实现代码和数据集。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedFuse是一个用于处理不规则临床时间序列的框架，通过乘法融合模块MuFuse将特征值和特征标识嵌入相结合，以捕捉特征间的高阶依赖关系，在多个真实世界数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床时间序列具有不规则性、异步采样、缺失值和异质特征动态等问题。现有嵌入策略通常通过加法操作结合特征标识和值嵌入，限制了捕捉值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse（乘法嵌入融合）模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，在保留特征特定信息的同时建模特征间的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在涵盖重症和慢性护理的三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上始终优于最先进的基线方法。学习表示的分析进一步证明乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了一个可泛化的方法，通过乘法融合有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出HyperD框架，通过将交通数据解耦为周期性和残差分量来解决交通预测中的空间依赖性和多尺度周期模式挑战，在四个真实数据集上实现了最先进的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测面临复杂空间依赖性和多尺度周期模式与不规则波动共存的挑战，需要有效处理周期性模式和突发事件的混合影响。

Method: 提出HyperD框架，将交通数据解耦为周期性和残差分量，使用混合周期表示模块处理周期性模式，频率感知残差表示模块处理非周期性波动，并引入双视图对齐损失确保语义分离。

Result: 在四个真实交通数据集上的实验表明，HyperD实现了最先进的预测精度，在干扰下具有更好的鲁棒性和更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: HyperD通过解耦周期性和非周期性分量，有效解决了交通预测中的关键挑战，为智能交通系统提供了可靠的预测解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

*Roland Aydin,Christian Cyron,Steve Bachelor,Ashton Anderson,Robert West*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出从"模型训练"转向"模型培养"的新范式，将价值对齐融入模型开发全过程，通过重新设计训练语料库来实现早期价值承诺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在核心能力建立后才进行价值对齐，导致模型容易失准且缺乏深层次价值体系。在LLM能力开始超越人类的背景下，需要从根本上改变训练范式。

Method: 重新设计训练语料库：采用第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社会互动、搭建训练数据的排序脚手架。

Result: 预期这种方法将使模型从第一个训练token开始就承诺价值观，使知识、技能和价值观内在难以分离。

Conclusion: 在LLM能力超越人类的生态系统中，这种从源头融入价值对齐的"模型培养"范式具有关键必要性。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要推动了量化方法的发展，但质性研究被忽视。研究人员在使用通用AI工具（如ChatGPT）进行质性分析时面临偏见、不透明、不可复现和隐私问题等挑战。

Method: 通过回顾现有文献，分析如何将自动化发现流程与稳健的质性能力相结合，并识别安全质性AI在多学科和混合方法研究中的关键机会。

Conclusion: 开发专门为质性研究设计的AI系统是必要的，这些系统应具备透明、可复现和隐私友好的特性，以促进多学科和混合方法研究的进展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 评估了2025年三个前沿大语言模型（DeepSeek R1、Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5）在PDDL规划和推理任务上的表现，发现GPT-5在标准PDDL领域与LAMA规划器竞争力相当，在混淆测试中所有LLM性能下降但比之前模型表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估前沿大语言模型在端到端规划任务中的推理能力，了解LLM在纯推理任务上的表现与专业规划器的差距。

Method: 使用国际规划竞赛学习赛道中的PDDL领域和任务子集，对三个前沿LLM进行测试，包括标准PDDL和混淆PDDL两种设置，以LAMA规划器作为参考基准。

Result: GPT-5在标准PDDL领域与LAMA规划器竞争力相当；在混淆PDDL测试中所有LLM性能下降，但下降程度比之前报告的模型要小；相比前代LLM有显著改进。

Conclusion: 前沿LLM在规划任务上取得了实质性进步，缩小了与专业规划器在挑战性基准测试中的性能差距。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Motivation: 在高维领域中访问学习表示中的信息对于科学发现至关重要，需要一种能够解缠潜在子空间的方法来分析、控制和重新利用潜在表示。

Method: 基于潜在流匹配与分类器自由引导，通过显式分离条件信息和残差表示来解缠潜在子空间。

Result: 在三个实验（合成2D高斯玩具问题、彩色MNIST和Galaxy10天文数据集）中证明该方法能够访问高维数据的有意义特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析、控制和重新利用潜在表示提供了一个简单而强大的机制，为使用生成模型进行科学探索提供了途径。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrochetBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域进行细粒度、低层次程序推理能力的基准测试，强调从描述转向实际操作，要求模型识别针法、选择结构适当的指令并生成可编译的钩针程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对模型执行实际程序推理能力的评估。CrochetBench旨在填补这一空白，通过钩针编织这一需要精确程序执行的创造性领域来评估模型的实际操作能力。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行进行功能评估。基准测试涵盖针法分类、指令接地、自然语言到DSL翻译和图像到DSL翻译等任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，模型性能急剧下降，暴露了长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成方面的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，并突显了在现实世界创造性领域中表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多模型聚合的AI安全方法，通过共识采样算法从k个模型中选择最安全的s个模型，在模型间达成足够共识时输出结果，否则弃权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法主要依赖检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险无法通过检查单独检测，需要架构无关的补充方法。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，利用模型计算输出概率的能力，当足够多的安全模型达成共识时输出结果，否则弃权。

Result: 该方法能够实现与最安全的s个模型平均风险相当的安全水平，并在模型间缺乏共识时可靠地弃权。

Conclusion: 提供了一种新的模型无关的AI安全方法，通过放大集合中未知安全子集的安全保证来构建可靠模型。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

Conclusion: 物理AI代表了理解智能的范式转变，将智能视为物理体现过程而非抽象计算，通过康复诊所中的自适应辅助机器人实例说明了六个基本原理在实际系统中的相互作用方式。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in multi-agent scenarios. We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent. We establish the conditions for asymmetric convergence and provide an algorithm that provably achieves an adversarial result, producing one-sided success. Experiments with trained transformer models as well as GPT$5$ for the task of in-context linear regression validate the theory. Our framework presents a setup to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems; explicitly linking prompt design and interaction setup to stability, bias, and robustness.

Conclusion: 理论证明访问或结构化建模全局效用函数对于分散执行约束下的贝叶斯纳什均衡是必要的，AA-MAMORL框架有效解决了MAMOS中的异构效用函数问题，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS) have emerged as powerful frameworks for modelling complex decision-making problems across various real-world domains, such as robotic exploration, autonomous traffic management, and sensor network optimisation. MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效优化多智能体通信协议，在通信效率和任务性能之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling complex interactions among autonomous entities in distributed environments. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), communication enables coordination but can lead to inefficient information exchange, since agents may generate redundant or non-essential messages. While prior work has focused on boosting task performance with information exchange, the existing research lacks a thorough investigation of both the appropriate definition and the optimization of communication protocols (communication topology and message). To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized framework for learning multi-round communication protocols that are both effective and efficient. Within this framework, we propose three novel Communication Efficiency Metrics (CEMs) to guide and evaluate the learning process: the Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) for efficiency-augmented optimization, and the Topology Efficiency Index (TEI) for explicit evaluation. We integrate IEI and SEI as the adjusted loss functions to promote informative messaging and role specialization, while using TEI to quantify the trade-off between communication volume and task performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our learned communication protocol can significantly enhance communication efficiency and achieves better cooperation performance with improved success rates.

Abstract: As modern software systems continue to grow in complexity, triage has become a fundamental process in system operations and maintenance. Triage aims to efficiently prioritize, assign, and assess issues to ensure the reliability of complex environments. The vast amount of heterogeneous data generated by software systems has made effective triage indispensable for maintaining reliability, facilitating maintainability, and enabling rapid issue response. Motivated by these challenges, researchers have devoted extensive effort to advancing triage automation and have achieved significant progress over the past two decades. This survey provides a comprehensive review of 234 papers from 2004 to the present, offering an in-depth examination of the fundamental concepts, system architecture, and problem statement. By comparing the distinct goals of academic and industrial research and by analyzing empirical studies of industrial practices, we identify the major obstacles that limit the practical deployment of triage systems. To assist practitioners in method selection and performance evaluation, we summarize widely adopted open-source datasets and evaluation metrics, providing a unified perspective on the measurement of triage effectiveness. Finally, we outline potential future directions and emerging opportunities to foster a closer integration between academic innovation and industrial application.

Abstract: This paper presents a detailed comparative analysis of the performance of three major Python data manipulation libraries - Pandas, Polars, and Dask - specifically when embedded within complete deep learning (DL) training and inference pipelines. The research bridges a gap in existing literature by studying how these libraries interact with substantial GPU workloads during critical phases like data loading, preprocessing, and batch feeding. The authors measured key performance indicators including runtime, memory usage, disk usage, and energy consumption (both CPU and GPU) across various machine learning models and datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了87个仓库中31,076个回传源的105,396次提交，发现在回传过程中约4.3%会引入新的技术债务，不同生态系统和开发阶段的技术债务模式存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究回传维护活动中新产生的技术债务，识别何时以及为何在稳定源代码的回传过程中会出现新的技术债务。

Method: 分析三个软件生态系统（Apache、Eclipse和Python）中87个仓库的31,076个回传源的105,396次提交，研究技术债务的产生模式。

Result: 约4.3%的回传引入了新的技术债务；Apache贡献了最多的绝对实例，而Python和Eclipse的债务提交比几乎是Apache的三倍；不同生态系统在不同发布阶段的技术债务积累模式不同；缺乏经验、工作负荷高或非所有者的开发者更可能在回传时引入技术债务。

Conclusion: 回传维护活动确实会引入技术债务，不同生态系统和开发阶段有不同的债务积累模式，开发者的经验和背景是影响技术债务引入的重要因素。

Abstract: Maintaining software is an ongoing process that stretches beyond the initial release. Stable software versions continuously evolve to fix bugs, add improvements, address security issues, and ensure compatibility. This ongoing support involves Backporting, which means taking a fix or update from a newer version and applying it to an older version of the same software. As software versions evolve, new technical debt can arise during backport maintenance activities. This study examines the technical debt involved in fixing 105,396 commits from 31,076 backport sources across 87 repositories in three software ecosystems (Apache, Eclipse, and Python). The goal is to identify when and why new technical debt arises during backporting in stable source code. Our results indicate that approximately 4.3% of backports introduce new technical debt. Apache contributes the most absolute instances, while Python and Eclipse exhibit nearly three times higher debt-to-commit ratios than Apache. Feature migrations make older Apache releases debt-prone in the early phase, whereas Python and Eclipse releases tend to accumulate technical debt mostly during the middle phase of their release cycles. Additionally, developers who are inexperienced, under high workloads, or non-owners are more likely to introduce technical debt during backporting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化测试计划生成方法，旨在减少生产环境中测试活动可能引起的服务中断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计测试计划繁琐且容易出错，特别是在系统庞大复杂时更加困难。生产环境中的测试活动需要妥善编排以避免干扰生产流量。

Method: 开发了一种自动化测试计划生成方法，包括测试配置选择/生成、测试配置部署规划、创建测试运行计划、选择减少干扰风险的策略等任务。

Result: 通过案例研究说明了该方法的不同方面，展示了自动化测试计划生成的可行性。

Conclusion: 自动化测试计划生成方法能够有效减少生产环境中测试活动引起的服务中断，提高测试效率并降低人为错误。

Abstract: Live testing is performed in the production environment ideally without causing unacceptable disturbance to the production traffic. Thus, test activities have to be orchestrated properly to avoid interferences with the production traffic. A test plan is the road map that specifies how the test activities need to be orchestrated. Developing a test plan includes tasks such as test configuration selection/generation, test configuration deployment planning, creating the test runs schedule, choosing strategies to mitigate the risk of interferences, etc. The manual design of a test plan is tedious and error prone. This task becomes harder especially when the systems are large and complex. In this paper we propose an approach for automating test plans generation. With this approach we aim at reducing service disruption that may be induced by the testing activities in production. We illustrate our approach with a case study and discuss its different aspects.

TL;DR: 开发了一个低数据领域的工业编程助手，通过RAG、多模型竞争和即时编译验证，在不微调大模型的情况下实现高质量PLC代码生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLC编程使用专有代码方言，难以训练编码助手；公司不信任云提供商，需要本地化解决方案；现有LLM不了解特定功能块和项目代码。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)和广泛提示工程，让多个AI模型竞争，结合推理、自动错误修正，并在聊天界面中直接编译验证代码有效性。

Result: 通过微调小型本地模型用于边缘设备，实现了高质量代码生成，支持代码编译统计和用户评分评估。

Conclusion: 在低数据领域，通过RAG支持的编码助手结合定向检索和提示工程可以有效工作，无需微调大型模型。

Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers are operated by proprietary code dialects; this makes it challenging to train coding assistants. Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.

TL;DR: SPLVD是一种基于自定进度学习的软件漏洞检测方法，通过动态选择训练数据模拟人类从易到难的学习过程，在多个数据集上超越了现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习漏洞检测方法的准确性有限，主要原因是训练数据质量低。需要一种能够从易到难渐进学习的机制来提高检测效果。

Method: 提出SPLVD方法，包含专门为漏洞检测任务设计的数据选择器，能够在每个训练周期前重新计算源代码难度、选择新训练数据并更新选择器。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，SPLVD分别达到89.2%、68.7%和43.5%的F1分数，优于现有方法。在OpenHarmony项目上达到90.9%的最高精确度。

Conclusion: SPLVD通过自定进度学习机制有效提升了软件漏洞检测性能，在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities are major risks to software systems. Recently, researchers have proposed many deep learning approaches to detect software vulnerabilities. However, their accuracy is limited in practice. One of the main causes is low-quality training data (i.e., source code). To this end, we propose a new approach: SPLVD (Self-Paced Learning for Software Vulnerability Detection). SPLVD dynamically selects source code for model training based on the stage of training, which simulates the human learning process progressing from easy to hard. SPLVD has a data selector that is specifically designed for the vulnerability detection task, which enables it to prioritize the learning of easy source code. Before each training epoch, SPLVD uses the data selector to recalculate the difficulty of the source code, select new training source code, and update the data selector. When evaluating SPLVD, we first use three benchmark datasets with over 239K source code in which 25K are vulnerable for standard evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that SPLVD achieves the highest F1 of 89.2%, 68.7%, and 43.5%, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. Then we collect projects from OpenHarmony, a new ecosystem that has not been learned by general LLMs, to evaluate SPLVD further. SPLVD achieves the highest precision of 90.9%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: AILINKPREVIEWER工具利用LLM生成PR中链接的预览，通过结合PR元数据提供更丰富的上下文信息，提升代码审查效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码审查中链接通常被丢弃，导致信息不完整和认知负担增加，需要工具来增强链接内容的可访问性。

Method: 分析50个GitHub仓库，比较三种方法：上下文LLM摘要、非上下文LLM摘要和基于元数据的预览。

Result: 上下文摘要在BLEU、BERTScore等指标上表现更好，但用户研究显示多数参与者更偏好非上下文摘要。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的链接预览有潜力提升代码审查效率，但需要在指标性能和用户体验之间找到平衡。

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, where developers evaluate code changes to ensure quality and maintainability. Links to issues and external resources are often included in Pull Requests (PRs) to provide additional context, yet they are typically discarded in automated tasks such as PR summarization and code review comment generation. This limits the richness of information available to reviewers and increases cognitive load by forcing context-switching. To address this gap, we present AILINKPREVIEWER, a tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate previews of links in PRs using PR metadata, including titles, descriptions, comments, and link body content. We analyzed 50 engineered GitHub repositories and compared three approaches: Contextual LLM summaries, Non-Contextual LLM summaries, and Metadata-based previews. The results in metrics such as BLEU, BERTScore, and compression ratio show that contextual summaries consistently outperform other methods. However, in a user study with seven participants, most preferred non-contextual summaries, suggesting a trade-off between metric performance and perceived usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-powered link previews to enhance code review efficiency and to provide richer context for developers and automation in software engineering.

Motivation: 由于手动创建用例模型耗时费力，实践中经常被跳过，本研究旨在探索LLM在辅助这一繁琐过程中的潜力。

Method: 集成开放权重LLM，采用先进的提示工程技术从软件需求中系统提取参与者和用例，并通过与五位专业软件工程师的探索性研究进行评估。

Result: 建模时间减少60%，模型质量与传统方法相当，参与者表示该方法在过程中提供了有价值的指导。

Conclusion: LLM辅助的用例建模方法能显著提高建模效率，同时保持质量，为实践提供了有价值的指导。

Abstract: Use case modeling employs user-centered scenarios to outline system requirements. These help to achieve consensus among relevant stakeholders. Because the manual creation of use case models is demanding and time-consuming, it is often skipped in practice. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in this tedious process. The proposed method integrates an open-weight LLM to systematically extract actors and use cases from software requirements with advanced prompt engineering techniques. The method is evaluated using an exploratory study conducted with five professional software engineers, which compares traditional manual modeling to the proposed LLM-based approach. The results show a substantial acceleration, reducing the modeling time by 60\%. At the same time, the model quality remains on par. Besides improving the modeling efficiency, the participants indicated that the method provided valuable guidance in the process.

Motivation: 智能代码助手的行为和效果高度依赖于定义架构约束、编码实践和工具使用策略的配置文件，但目前对这些配置工件的结构和内容了解甚少。

Method: 收集并分析了328个来自公开Claude Code项目的配置文件，识别了(i)这些文件指定的软件工程关注点和实践，以及(ii)这些关注点在单个文件中的共现情况。

Result: 研究结果强调了在智能体配置文件中定义广泛关注点和实践的重要性，特别是指定智能体应遵循的架构。

Conclusion: 配置生态系统对于智能代码助手的有效运行至关重要，需要明确定义架构约束和编码实践来指导智能体的行为。

Abstract: Agentic code assistants are a new generation of AI systems capable of performing end-to-end software engineering tasks. While these systems promise unprecedented productivity gains, their behavior and effectiveness depend heavily on configuration files that define architectural constraints, coding practices, and tool usage policies. However, little is known about the structure and content of these configuration artifacts. This paper presents an empirical study of the configuration ecosystem of Claude Code, one of the most widely used agentic coding systems. We collected and analyzed 328 configuration files from public Claude Code projects to identify (i) the software engineering concerns and practices they specify and (ii) how these concerns co-occur within individual files. The results highlight the importance of defining a wide range of concerns and practices in agent configuration files, with particular emphasis on specifying the architecture the agent should follow.

TL;DR: Routesplain是首个针对软件相关任务的LLM路由器，通过提取可解释的概念进行路由决策，在准确性和成本方面优于单个模型，并达到或超过所有黑盒基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在软件相关任务上表现差异显著，通过路由用户查询到合适的LLM可以提高响应质量并降低成本，但之前的工作主要关注通用目的的LLM路由。

Method: Routesplain从每个查询中提取人类可解释的概念（如任务类型、领域、推理复杂度），仅基于这些概念进行路由，提供可理解、可信的推理过程。

Result: 在16个最先进LLM和8个软件相关任务上的评估显示，Routesplain在准确性和成本方面优于单个模型，并等于或超过所有黑盒基线。

Conclusion: Routesplain通过概念级干预展示了进一步改进路由器的途径，为软件相关任务的LLM路由提供了可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs now tackle a wide range of software-related tasks, yet we show that their performance varies markedly both across and within these tasks. Routing user queries to the appropriate LLMs can therefore help improve response quality while reducing cost. Prior work, however, has focused mainly on general-purpose LLM routing via black-box models. We introduce Routesplain, the first LLM router for software-related tasks, including multilingual code generation and repair, input/output prediction, and computer science QA. Unlike existing routing approaches, Routesplain first extracts human-interpretable concepts from each query (e.g., task, domain, reasoning complexity) and only routes based on these concepts, thereby providing intelligible, faithful rationales. We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements.
