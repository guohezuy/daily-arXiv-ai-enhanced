An Empirical Study of Dependency Amplification Across 10 Package Ecosystems", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern software development relies on package ecosystems where a single declared dependency can pull in many additional transitive packages. This dependency amplification, defined as the ratio of transitive to direct dependencies, has major implications for software supply chain security, yet amplification patterns across ecosystems have not been compared at scale. We present an empirical study of 500 projects across ten major ecosystems, including Maven Central for Java, npm Registry for JavaScript, crates io for Rust, PyPI for Python, NuGet Gallery for dot NET, RubyGems for Ruby, Go Modules for Go, Packagist for PHP, CocoaPods for Swift and Objective C, and Pub for Dart. Our analysis shows that Maven exhibits mean amplification of 24.70 times, compared to 4.48 times for Go Modules, 4.32 times for npm, and 0.32 times for CocoaPods. We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages. We observe that 28 percent of Maven projects exceed 10 times amplification, indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated outliers, compared to 14 percent for RubyGems, 12 percent for npm, and zero percent for Cargo, PyPI, Packagist, CocoaPods, and Pub. We attribute these differences to ecosystem design choices such as dependency resolution behavior, standard library completeness, and platform constraints. Our findings suggest adopting ecosystem specific security strategies, including systematic auditing for Maven environments, targeted outlier detection for npm and RubyGems, and continuation of current practices for ecosystems with controlled amplification. We provide a full replication package with data and analysis scripts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8610\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Maven\u7684\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u6700\u9ad8\uff08\u5e73\u574724.7\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u800cCocoaPods\u6700\u4f4e\uff080.32\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86npm\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u9879\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u7684\u653e\u5927\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c1a\u672a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf910\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08Maven\u3001npm\u3001crates.io\u3001PyPI\u3001NuGet\u3001RubyGems\u3001Go Modules\u3001Packagist\u3001CocoaPods\u3001Pub\uff09\u4e2d\u7684500\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f20\u9012\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "Maven\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0824.70\u500d\uff09\uff0cGo Modules\u4e3a4.48\u500d\uff0cnpm\u4e3a4.32\u500d\uff0cCocoaPods\u6700\u4f4e\u4e3a0.32\u500d\u300245\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u670922\u5bf9\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u300228%\u7684Maven\u9879\u76ee\u8d85\u8fc710\u500d\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u800cCargo\u3001PyPI\u7b49\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u96f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u4f9d\u8d56\u89e3\u6790\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff1aMaven\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0cnpm\u548cRubyGems\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5ef6\u7eed\u5f53\u524d\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

Despite their increasing application, there are still no systematic guidelines for the modelling of such conceptual models. To fill this gap, this study introduces the Value Driver Modelling Notation (VDMN), a graphical notation developed to systematically guide VDT modelling. This notation includes a comprehensive set of semantic constructs and an intuitive graphical syntax. To evaluate its practical utility, the VDMN was applied in two case studies and assessed through expert interviews. The results show that the notation supports a consistent and comprehensible modelling of VDTs.

However, these impressive scores do not necessarily translate to reliable services in real-world use, where users often vary their phrasing, contextual framing, and task formulations. In this paper, we study nuance-oriented reliability: whether models exhibit consistent competence across cousin prompts that convey analogous user intents but with subtle nuances. To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications. What's more, we characterize it and explore three potential improvement recipes.

Kapitsaki"], "title": "Examining Software Developers' Needs for Privacy Enforcing Techniques: A survey", "comment": "8 pages", "summary": "Data privacy legislation, such as GDPR and CCPA/CPRA, has rendered data privacy law compliance a requirement of all software systems. Developers need to implement various kinds of functionalities to cover law needs, including user rights and law principles. As data compliance is tightly coupled with legal knowledge, it is not always easy to perform such integrations in software systems. Prior studies have focused on developers' understanding of privacy principles, such as Privacy by Design, and have examined privacy techniques used in the software industry. Nevertheless, emerging developer needs that can assist in privacy law compliance have not been examined but are useful in understanding what development automation tools, such as Generative AI, need to cover to make the compliance process more straightforward and seamless within the development process. In this work, we present a survey that examines the above needs with the participation of 68 developers, while we have examined which factors affect practitioners' needs. Most developers express a need for more automated tools, while privacy experience increases practitioners' concerns for privacy tools. Our results can assist practitioners in better positioning their development activities within privacy law compliance and point to an urgent need for privacy facilitators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u5408\u89c4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "motivation": "GDPR\u3001CCPA/CPRA\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fc5\u987b\u5408\u89c4\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9700\u8981\u6cd5\u5f8b\u77e5\u8bc6\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u89c4\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u539f\u5219\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff09\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5\u95ee\u5377\u6536\u96c6\u4e8668\u540d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9690\u79c1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5bf9\u5de5\u5177\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8868\u793a\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u534f\u52a9\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u5408\u89c4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d8a\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8d8a\u5173\u6ce8\u9690\u79c1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u8c03\u67e5\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u5408\u89c4\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Previous machine learning and deep learning detection tools are constrained by their reliance on large-scale labeled data and an lack of interpretability. Although multi-agent systems have demonstrated robust capabilities, the potential of such systems for PCOS detection remains largely unexplored. Existing medical multi-agent frameworks are predominantly designed for general medical tasks, suffering from insufficient domain integration and a lack of specific domain knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Mapis, the first knowledge-grounded multi-agent framework explicitly designed for guideline-based PCOS diagnosis. Specifically, it built upon the 2023 International Guideline into a structured collaborative workflow that simulates the clinical diagnostic process. It decouples complex diagnostic tasks across specialized agents: a gynecological endocrine agent and a radiology agent collaborative to verify inclusion criteria, while an exclusion agent strictly rules out other causes. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive PCOS knowledge graph to ensure verifiable, evidence-based decision-making. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and specialized clinical datasets, benchmarking against nine diverse baselines, demonstrate that Mapis significantly outperforms competitive methods. On the clinical dataset, it surpasses traditional machine learning models by 13.56%, single-agent by 6.55%, and previous medical multi-agent systems by 7.05% in Accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mapis\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u5357\u7684\u591a\u56ca\u5375\u5de2\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u56ca\u5375\u5de2\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd10%\u7684\u80b2\u9f84\u5973\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3PCOS\u8bca\u65ad\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e2023\u5e74\u56fd\u9645\u6307\u5357\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u7ed9\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1a\u5987\u79d1\u5185\u5206\u6ccc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7eb3\u5165\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e25\u683c\u6392\u9664\u5176\u4ed6\u75c5\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u9762\u7684PCOS\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u786e\u4fdd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMapis\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9ad813.56%\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9ad86.55%\uff0c\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u533b\u7597\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad87.05%\u3002", "conclusion": "Mapis\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u5357\u7684PCOS\u8bca\u65ad\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u6574\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u4e3aPCOS\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.\n  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.\n  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.\n  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86OpenAI\u5173\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0d\u5f53\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5e7b\u89c9\u662fTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5fc5\u7136\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6fc0\u52b1\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5f03\u6743\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "OpenAI\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0d\u5f53\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u81ea\u4fe1\u731c\u6d4b\u800c\u975e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8c26\u900a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6311\u6218\u8fd9\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0d\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u800c\u662fTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5fc5\u7136\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Licensing Oracle\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u8bba\u8bc1Transformer\u4e0d\u8868\u793a\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5efa\u6a21token\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f62\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5171\u73b0\u800c\u975e\u4e16\u754c\u53c2\u7167\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4f2a\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u6fc0\u52b1\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u6765\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5f03\u6743\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u3002Licensing Oracle\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9bTransformer\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u63a5\u5730\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5f03\u6743\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u9700\u8981\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d23\u4efb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8865\u5145Transformer\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Accepted at Advances in Representation Learning for Earth Observation (REO) at EurIPS 2025", "summary": "Change detection for linear infrastructure monitoring requires reliable high-resolution data and regular acquisition cadence. Optical very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery is interpretable and straightforward to label, but clouds break this cadence. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables all-weather acquisitions, yet is difficult to annotate. We introduce SkyCap, a bitemporal VHR optical-SAR dataset constructed by archive matching and co-registration of (optical) SkySat and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. We utilize optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection (ACD) labels without requiring SAR-expert annotations. We perform continued pretraining of SARATR-X on our SAR data and benchmark the resulting SAR-specific foundation models (FMs) together with SARATR-X against optical FMs on SkyCap under different preprocessing choices.

Submitted to 'Logical and Symbolic Reasoning in Language Models @ AAAI 2026' conference and is under review", "summary": "Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring \"VSA-likeness\" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06Transformer\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ee3\u6570\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faVSA\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\u5b9a\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u503c\u7f16\u7801\u586b\u5145\u7269\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u6267\u884c\u8f6f\u89e3\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faVSA\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u504f\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed1\u5b9a/\u89e3\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5934\u3001\u8d85\u7ef4\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\uff09\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u89c6\u89d2\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d8\u91cf\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u76f8\u5173\u63d0\u793a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u5178\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\"VSA\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\"\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89c6\u4e3a\u8f6f\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Pre-training produces intelligence, and post-training optimizes preferences, but neither guarantees that models reliably satisfy explicit, context-dependent constraints. This missing abstraction explains why highly intelligent models routinely fail in deployment despite strong benchmark performance.\n  We introduce Capability Engineering, the systematic practice of converting requirements into executable specifications and training models to satisfy them by default. We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.\n  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent).

However, the persistence of the implanted backdoors under user-driven post-deployment continual fine-tuning has been rarely examined. Most prior works evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of implanted backdoors only at releasing and empirical evidence shows that naively injected backdoor persistence degrades after updates. In this work, we study whether and how implanted backdoors persist through a multi-stage post-deployment fine-tuning. We propose P-Trojan, a trigger-based attack algorithm that explicitly optimizes for backdoor persistence across repeated updates. By aligning poisoned gradients with those of clean tasks on token embeddings, the implanted backdoor mapping is less likely to be suppressed or forgotten during subsequent updates. Theoretical analysis shows the feasibility of such persistent backdoor attacks after continual fine-tuning. And experiments conducted on the Qwen2.5 and LLaMA3 families of LLMs, as well as diverse task sequences, demonstrate that P-Trojan achieves over 99% persistence while preserving clean-task accuracy.

Socially compliant navigation that accounts for human comfort, social norms, and contextual appropriateness remains underexplored. Vision language models (VLMs) show promise for this task; however, large-scale models incur substantial computational overhead, leading to higher inference latency and energy consumption, which makes them unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned).

This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574KG\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08GR-Agent\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u662f\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002\u5f53\u76f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u9650\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u76f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u66ff\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff1b2) \u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08GR-Agent\uff09\uff0c\u5c06KGQA\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ef4\u62a4\u5305\u542b\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u652f\u6301\u8bc1\u636e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574KG\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b2) GR-Agent\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86KGQA\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684GR-Agent\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574KG\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether the media landscape offers a balanced and fair account of public debate. In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy). In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata. We evaluate our approach against alternative solutions on a benchmark centred on the UK immigration debate.

Our approach adopts a top-down expert-system design, leveraging traditional computer-vision techniques (e.g., phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) to capitalize on prior knowledge, while integrating unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings. This hybrid strategy strikes a balance between interpretability and accuracy. Evaluated on The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, our system massively digitizes (i) a melody-only collection of more than 5,000 songs (> 300,000 notes) and (ii) a curated subset with lyrics comprising over 1,400 songs (> 100,000 notes). The system achieves high-precision recognition on both melody (note-wise F1 = 0.951) and aligned lyrics (character-wise F1 = 0.931).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u5e26\u6709\u6b4c\u8bcd\u7684\u5370\u5237\u7b80\u8c31\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684MusicXML\u548cMIDI\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u300a\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c11\u6b4c\u9009\u96c6\u300b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5149\u5b66\u97f3\u4e50\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u897f\u65b9\u4e94\u7ebf\u8c31\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u4e2d\u56fd\u7b80\u8c31\u53ca\u5176\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6b4c\u8bcd\u8d44\u6e90\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b80\u8c31\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u4e50\u53e5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9aa8\u67b6\u5206\u6790\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u96c6\u6210\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u300a\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c11\u6b4c\u9009\u96c6\u300b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u5b57\u5316\uff1a1\uff09\u8d85\u8fc75,000\u9996\u7eaf\u65cb\u5f8b\u6b4c\u66f2\uff08>300,000\u4e2a\u97f3\u7b26\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u8d85\u8fc71,400\u9996\u5e26\u6b4c\u8bcd\u7684\u7cbe\u9009\u5b50\u96c6\uff08>100,000\u4e2a\u97f3\u7b26\uff09\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65cb\u5f8b\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u97f3\u7b26\u7ea7F1=0.951\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b4c\u8bcd\uff08\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7F1=0.931\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e2d\u6587\u7b80\u8c31\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5149\u5b66\u97f3\u4e50\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b80\u8c31\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This research investigated methods to improve LLM-based IaC generation, specifically for Terraform, by systematically injecting structured configuration knowledge. To facilitate this, an existing IaC-Eval benchmark was significantly enhanced with cloud emulation and automated error analysis. Additionally, a novel error taxonomy for LLM-assisted IaC code generation was developed. A series of knowledge injection techniques was implemented and evaluated, progressing from Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to more sophisticated Graph RAG approaches. These included semantic enrichment of graph components and modeling inter-resource dependencies. Experimental results demonstrated that while baseline LLM performance was poor (27.1% overall success), injecting structured configuration knowledge increased technical validation success to 75.3% and overall success to 62.6%.

This shift depends on the availability of reliable verifiers, which AI-driven approaches require to validate candidate solutions. Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight. Note: This paper is an extension of our prior work [14]. It adds extensive evaluation across multiple ADRS frameworks and provides deeper analysis and insights into best practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76(ADRS)\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AI\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684SOTA\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u6b63\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8fd9\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u5929\u7136\u5177\u5907\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u53ef\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faADRS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90ADRS\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff08OpenEvolve\u3001GEPA\u3001ShinkaEvolve\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "ADRS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4f7f\u7528ADRS\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u89c4\u8303\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u91cf\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u901a\u7528ADRS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u521d\u6b65\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cd\u5fc3\u5c06\u9010\u6e10\u8f6c\u5411\u95ee\u9898\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u6218\u7565\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

Factored cognition protocols decompose complex tasks into simpler child tasks: one model creates the decomposition, while other models implement the child tasks in isolation. Prior work uses trusted (weaker but reliable) models for decomposition, which limits usefulness for tasks where decomposition itself is challenging. We introduce Factor($U$,$T$), in which an untrusted (stronger but potentially malicious) model decomposes while trusted models implement child tasks. Can monitors detect malicious activity when observing only natural language task instructions, rather than complete solutions?

We measured baseline accuracy for each model without modification. We then developed a three-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, DrugRAG, that retrieves structured drug knowledge from validated sources and augments model prompts with evidence-based context. This pipeline operates externally to the models, requiring no changes to model architecture or parameters.\n  Results: Baseline accuracy ranged from 46% to 92%, with GPT-5 (92%) and o3 (89%) achieving the highest scores. Models with fewer than 8 billion parameters scored below 50%. DrugRAG improved accuracy across all tested models, with gains ranging from 7 to 21 percentage points (e.g., Gemma 3 27B: 61% to 71%, Llama 3.1 8B: 46% to 67%) on the 141-item benchmark.\n  Conclusion: We demonstrate that external structured drug knowledge integration through DrugRAG measurably improves LLM accuracy on pharmacy tasks without modifying the underlying models.

Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers. Experiments on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that, with additional tools and prompt refinement, AgroAskAI delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs.

We present BlindSpot, an on-device system that enables bystanders to manage their own privacy by signaling their privacy preferences in real-time without previously sharing any sensitive information. Our main contribution is the design and comparative evaluation of three distinct signaling modalities: a hand gesture mechanism, a significantly improved visible light communication (VLC) protocol, and a novel ultra-wideband (UWB) communication protocol. For all these modalities, we also design a validation mechanism that uses geometric consistency checks to verify the origin of a signal relative to the sending bystander, and defend against impersonation attacks. We implement the complete system (BlindSpot) on a commodity smartphone and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of each modality's accuracy and latency across various distances, lighting conditions, and user movements. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of these novel bystander signaling techniques and their trade-offs in terms of system performance and convenience.", "AI": {"tldr": "BlindSpot\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8ba9\u65c1\u89c2\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8fbe\u9690\u79c1\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u5171\u4eab\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u624b\u52bf\u3001\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8d85\u5bbd\u5e26\u901a\u4fe1\u4e09\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\uff08\u624b\u673a\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u773c\u955c\u3001AR\u5934\u663e\uff09\u5bf9\u65c1\u89c2\u8005\u9690\u79c1\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5236\u8ba9\u65c1\u89c2\u8005\u63a7\u5236\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u9762\u90e8\u88ab\u62cd\u6444\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u624b\u52bf\u673a\u5236\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u65b0\u578b\u8d85\u5bbd\u5e26\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\uff1b\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6e90\uff1b\u5728\u5546\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65c1\u89c2\u8005\u4fe1\u53f7\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "BlindSpot\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8ba9\u65c1\u89c2\u8005\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ba1\u7406\u81ea\u5df1\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention.

However, the susceptibility of VLMs to hallucinations can lead to overconfident yet incorrect answers, severely undermining answer reliability. To address this, we propose Dual-Assessment for VLM Reliability (DAVR), a novel framework that integrates Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification for comprehensive uncertainty estimation. The DAVR framework features a dual-pathway architecture: one pathway leverages dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings, while the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations. Evaluated in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, DAVR achieves a leading $\u03a6_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the trustworthiness of VLM responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAVR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56de\u7b54\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u4f46\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAVR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4e00\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u878d\u5408VLM\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u548cQA\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u54cd\u5e94\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u90e8\u7f72\u5916\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4ea4\u53c9\u68c0\u67e5\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e7b\u89c9", "result": "\u5728ICCV-CLVL 2025\u7684Reliable VQA\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0cDAVR\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u7684\u03a6100\u5206\u657039.64\u548c100-AUC\u5206\u657097.22\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u7b2c\u4e00\u540d", "conclusion": "DAVR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3VLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848"}}

In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68cb\u76d8\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u955c\u50cf\u5bf9\u79f0\u3001\u989c\u8272\u53cd\u8f6c\u7b49\u4e0d\u53d8\u53d8\u6362\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8c61\u68cb\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8c61\u68cb\uff09\u4e2d\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u51e0\u4f55\u6982\u5ff5\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u4ec5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6807\u51c6\u68cb\u76d8\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68cb\u76d8\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u955c\u50cf\u5bf9\u79f0\u3001\u989c\u8272\u53cd\u8f6c\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u7b49\u4e0d\u53d8\u53d8\u6362\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5bf96\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ecGPT-5.1\u3001Claude Sonnet 4.5\u3001Kimi K2 Turbo\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u7ea63000\u4e2a\u68cb\u5c40\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff1aGPT-5.1\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u98d9\u5347600%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002Claude Sonnet 4.5\u548cKimi K2 Turbo\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u6362\u8f74\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002Gemini 2.5 Flash\u5728\u975e\u6cd5\u72b6\u6001\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0896.0%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3aAI\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e14\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u903b\u8f91\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects.

We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided.

Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure.

However, its security implications remain unclear, particularly regarding whether finetuned LLMs inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from their pretrained sources. We investigate this question in a realistic pretrain-to-finetune threat model, where the attacker has white-box access to the pretrained LLM and only black-box access to its finetuned derivatives. Empirical analysis shows that adversarial prompts optimized on the pretrained model transfer most effectively to its finetuned variants, revealing inherited vulnerabilities from pretrained to finetuned LLMs. To further examine this inheritance, we conduct representation-level probing, which shows that transferable prompts are linearly separable within the pretrained hidden states, suggesting that universal transferability is encoded in pretrained representations. Building on this insight, we propose the Probe-Guided Projection (PGP) attack, which steers optimization toward transferability-relevant directions. Experiments across multiple LLM families and diverse finetuned tasks confirm PGP's strong transfer success, underscoring the security risks inherent in the pretrain-to-finetune paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLM\u4f1a\u7ee7\u627f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684PGP\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLM\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u7ee7\u627f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5230\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5230\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u62e5\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6295\u5f71\u7684PGP\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5176\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\uff0cPGP\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5230\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u786e\u5b9e\u4f1a\u7ee7\u627f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0cPGP\u653b\u51fb\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5230\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, as wireless environments become increasingly dynamic and complex, ISAC systems require more intelligent processing and more autonomous operation to maintain efficiency and adaptability. Meanwhile, agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a feasible solution to address these challenges by enabling continuous perception-reasoning-action loops in dynamic environments to support intelligent, autonomous, and efficient operation for ISAC systems. As such, we delve into the application value and prospects of agentic AI in ISAC systems in this work. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive review of agentic AI and ISAC systems to demonstrate their key characteristics. Secondly, we show several common optimization approaches for ISAC systems and highlight the significant advantages of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based agentic AI. Thirdly, we propose a novel agentic ISAC framework and prensent a case study to verify its superiority in optimizing ISAC performance.

Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.\n  We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \\textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \\textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797.

It is especially important to watermark LLM-generated code, as it often contains intellectual property.However, we found that existing methods for watermarking LLM-generated code fail to address comment removal attack.In such cases, an attacker can simply remove the comments from the generated code without affecting its functionality, significantly reducing the effectiveness of current code-watermarking techniques.On the other hand, injecting a watermark into code is challenging because, as previous works have noted, most code represents a low-entropy scenario compared to natural language. Our approach to addressing this issue involves leveraging prior knowledge to distinguish between low-entropy and high-entropy parts of the code, as indicated by a Cue List of words.We then inject the watermark guided by this Cue List, achieving higher detectability and usability than existing methods.We evaluated our proposed method on HumanEvaland compared our method with three state-of-the-art code watermarking techniques.

Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings.

However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "CogER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5e73\u8861LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56LLM\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u5feb\u6162\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982o1\u601d\u7ef4\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u67e5\u8be2\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bc4\u4f30\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u5230\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ea7\u522b\uff1b2) \u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3CogER-Agent\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u8ba4\u77e5\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "CogER\u5728In-Domain\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c1113%\uff0c\u5728Out-of-Domain\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53478%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CogER\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, information-theoretic approach to feature valuation using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). However, its original formulation did not provide a practical implementation capable of computing the required permutations and intersections securely. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving implementation of Shapley-CMI for VFL. Our system introduces a private set intersection (PSI) server that performs all necessary feature permutations and computes encrypted intersection sizes across discretized and encrypted ID groups, without the need for raw data exchange. Each party then uses these intersection results to compute Shapley-CMI values, computing the marginal utility of their features. Initial experiments confirm the correctness and privacy of the proposed system, demonstrating its viability for secure and efficient feature contribution estimation in VFL. This approach ensures data confidentiality, scales across multiple parties, and enables fair data valuation without requiring the sharing of raw data or training models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7eb5\u5411\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4Shapley-CMI\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79c1\u6709\u96c6\u5408\u4ea4\u96c6\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u503c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7eb5\u5411\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5404\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u62e5\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u65b9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684Shapley-CMI\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7279\u5f81\u4f30\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u5b89\u5168\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u9700\u6392\u5217\u548c\u4ea4\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684Shapley-CMI\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u79c1\u6709\u96c6\u5408\u4ea4\u96c6\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6765\u6267\u884c\u6240\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6ID\u7ec4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u4ea4\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u5404\u65b9\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ea4\u96c6\u7ed3\u679c\u8ba1\u7b97Shapley-CMI\u503c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7eb5\u5411\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u65b9\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4Shapley-CMI\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u7eb5\u5411\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u65b9\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u7ec4\u51cf\u5c11\u52a8\u6001\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728MWISP\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u677e\u5f1b\u51b3\u7b56\u56fe(DD)\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6536\u7d27\u8fb9\u754c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u7c07\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u6307\u5bfc\u6392\u5e8f\uff1a1) Cluster-to-Cluster\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u805a\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u987a\u5e8f\u5904\u7406\u7c07\uff1b2) Pick-and-Sort\u8fed\u4ee3\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c07\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u9488\u5bf9MWISP\u63a8\u5bfcDD\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7c07\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u5728MWISP\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e00\u81f4\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500"}}

While top-tier SE venues continue to show sustained or emerging focus on areas like automated testing and program repair, with researchers worldwide reporting continuous performance gains, the alignment of these academic advances with real industrial needs remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 1,367 papers published in FSE, ASE, and ICSE between 2022 and 2025, identifying key research topics, commonly used benchmarks, industrial relevance, and open-source availability. We then carry out an empirical survey across 17 organizations, collecting 282 responses on six prominent topics, i.e., program analysis, automated testing, code generation/completion, issue resolution, pre-trained code models, and dependency management, through structured questionnaires. By contrasting academic capabilities with industrial feedback, we derive seven critical implications, highlighting under-addressed challenges in software requirements and architecture, the reliability and explainability of intelligent SE approaches, input assumptions in academic research, practical evaluation tensions, and ethical considerations.

We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates. We establish MM-TOXIC-QA, a multimodal toxicity evaluation framework, and compare SGM with existing detoxification techniques. Experiments on open-source MLLMs show that SGM mitigates toxicity in standard and adversarial conditions, cutting harmful rates from 48.2\\% to 2.5\\% while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning.

However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics.

This forces business processes designers to manually run single executions of their BPMN+DMN processes using proprietary tools in order to detect failures. Furthermore, how proprietary tools translate a BPMN+DMN process to a computer simulation is left unspecified. In this paper, we advance this state of the art by designing a tool, named BDTransTest providing: i) a translation from a BPMN + DMN process B to a Java program P ; ii) the synthesis and execution of a testing plan for B, that may require the business designer to disambiguate some input domain; iii) the analysis of the coverage achieved by the testing plan in terms of nodes and edges of B.

Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge.

DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers. It integrates: (i) adaptive conformance mechanisms that link metamodels with evolving models and (ii) a large language model (LLM) validated alignment process that grounds metamodels in domain knowledge, ensuring structural fidelity and conceptual consistency throughout the DT lifecycle.

Although recent work by Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks demonstrated that ChatGPT-4o successfully executes attacks as an agent that it refuses in chat mode, there is no comparative analysis in multiple models and frameworks. We conducted the first systematic penetration testing and comparative evaluation of agentic AI systems, testing five prominent models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 2, and Nova Pro) across two agentic AI frameworks (AutoGen and CrewAI) using a seven-agent architecture that mimics the functionality of a university information management system and 13 distinct attack scenarios that span prompt injection, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), SQL injection, and tool misuse. Our 130 total test cases reveal significant security disparities: AutoGen demonstrates a 52.3% refusal rate versus CrewAI's 30.8%, while model performance ranges from Nova Pro's 46.2% to Claude and Grok 2's 38.5%. Most critically, Grok 2 on CrewAI rejected only 2 of 13 attacks (15.4% refusal rate), and the overall refusal rate of 41.5% across all configurations indicates that more than half of malicious prompts succeeded despite enterprise-grade safety mechanisms. We identify six distinct defensive behavior patterns including a novel \"hallucinated compliance\" strategy where models fabricate outputs rather than executing or refusing attacks, and provide actionable recommendations for secure agent deployment.

However, this voting strategy often induces confirmation bias and suffers from sparse rewards, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we propose subgroup-specific step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-label estimation (SCOPE), a framework integrating model confidence and dynamic subgroup partitioning to address these issues. Specifically, SCOPE integrates the proposed step-wise confidence into pseudo label deduction, prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths over simple frequency count. Furthermore, it dynamically partitions the candidate outputs pool into independent subgroups by balancing reasoning quality against exploration diversity. By deriving local consensus via repeat sampling for each sub group, SCOPE provides diverse supervision targets to encourage broader exploration. We conduct experiments across various models and benchmarks, experimental results show that SCOPE consistently outperforms recent baselines. Notably, SCOPE achieving relative improvements of 13.1\\% on challenging AIME 2025 and 8.1\\% on AMC.

While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation.

As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that \"Perception Errors\" were dominant, highlighting a \"Perception-Cognition Gap\" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a \"Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy,\" successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and \"Process Hallucination,\" where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing \"AI-resistant questions\" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u97e9\u56fd\u9ad8\u8003\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66I\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86GPT-4o\u3001Gemini 2.5 Flash\u548cGemini 2.5 Pro\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u5728\u611f\u77e5-\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\"\u6297AI\u95ee\u9898\"\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5b66\u751f\u4f7f\u7528AI\u5b8c\u6210\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6ee5\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282025\u5e74\u97e9\u56fd\u9ad8\u8003\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66I\u90e8\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u6574\u9875\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u5355\u9879\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5bf9GPT-4o\u3001Gemini 2.5 Flash\u548cGemini 2.5 Pro\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\"\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\"\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\"\u611f\u77e5-\u8ba4\u77e5\u9e3f\u6c9f\"\u3001\"\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\"\u548c\"\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e7b\u89c9\"\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9AI\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f31\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\"\u6297AI\u95ee\u9898\"\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u5b66\u751f\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\u4e0eAI\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Cloud SOC triages high-volume, heterogeneous telemetry from elastic, short-lived resources while staying within tight budgets. In this research, we implement an AI-Augmented Security Operations Center (AISOC) on AWS that combines cloud-native instrumentation with ML-based detection. The architecture uses three Amazon EC2 instances: Attacker, Defender, and Monitoring. We simulate a reverse-shell intrusion with Metasploit, and Filebeat forwards Defender logs to an Elasticsearch and Kibana stack for analysis. We train two classifiers, a malware detector built on a public dataset and a log-anomaly detector trained on synthetically augmented logs that include adversarial variants. We calibrate and fuse the scores to produce multi-modal threat intelligence and triage activity into NORMAL, SUSPICIOUS, and HIGH\\_CONFIDENCE\\_ATTACK. On held-out tests the fusion achieves strong macro-F1 (up to 1.00) under controlled conditions, though performance will vary in noisier and more diverse environments. These results indicate that simple, calibrated fusion can enhance cloud SOC capabilities in constrained, cost-sensitive setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728AWS\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5a01\u80c1\u60c5\u62a5\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u4e91SOC\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u4e91\u5b89\u5168\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u7684\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f39\u6027\u3001\u77ed\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u5728AWS\u4e0a\u6784\u5efaAISOC\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2aEC2\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff08\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u3001\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u62dfMetasploit\u53cd\u5411shell\u5165\u4fb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Filebeat\u8f6c\u53d1\u65e5\u5fd7\u5230Elasticsearch/Kibana\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u5206\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5a01\u80c1\u5206\u7c7b", "result": "\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe1.00\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u6d3b\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u6b63\u5e38\u3001\u53ef\u7591\u548c\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u66f4\u5608\u6742\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u6709\u6240\u53d8\u5316", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u589e\u5f3a\u4e91SOC\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660eAI\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e91\u5b89\u5168\u8fd0\u8425\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web", "comment": "Accepted on ICSE 2026", "summary": "Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Aletheia\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6284\u88ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u6790JavaScript\u6346\u7ed1\u5305\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b05%-20%\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u572816\u5468\u5185\u66f4\u65b0\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u6346\u7ed1\u5305\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4CDN\u5305\u5feb10\u500d\uff0c\u4f46\u5c11\u6570\u5927\u578b\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u662f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u52a8\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "JavaScript\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u70ed\u95e8\u5305\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u6587\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u4ee3Web\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAletheia\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5305\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u501f\u9274\u6284\u88ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5256\u6790JavaScript\u6346\u7ed1\u5305\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u7248\u672c\u3002", "result": "Aletheia\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5bf9Tranco\u524d10\u4e07\u4e2a\u57df\u540d\u7684\u722c\u53d6\u663e\u793a\uff1a5%-20%\u7684\u57df\u540d\u572816\u5468\u5185\u66f4\u65b0\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u6346\u7ed1\u5305\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5feb\u4e8eCDN\u5305\u542b\u7684\u5305\uff0c\u5df2\u77e5\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7248\u672c\u51cf\u5c1110\u500d\uff1b\u5c11\u6570\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u662f\u53ca\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u52a8\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u6346\u7ed1\u5305\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u65b0\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u5927\u578b\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u53ca\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode.

These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine. Our contribution enables the AAS to serve not only as a passive digital representation but also as an active interface for executing added-value services.%, thereby laying the foundation for future AI-driven adaptation and system-level intelligence in digital twin environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684AAS\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u96c6\u6210\u4f7f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u670d\u52a1\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8eAAS\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u670d\u52a1\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e6\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\u90e8\u7f72\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u8f74\u94e3\u5e8a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f7fAAS\u80fd\u591f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6267\u884c\u589e\u503c\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7fAAS\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u670d\u52a1\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The manuscript has been accepted for publication at SANER 2026!", "summary": "Monitoring issue tracker submissions is a crucial software maintenance activity. A key goal is the prioritization of high risk, security-related bugs. If such bugs can be recognized early, the risk of propagation to dependent products and endangerment of stakeholder benefits can be mitigated. To assist triage engineers with this task, several automatic detection techniques, from Machine Learning (ML) models to prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), have been proposed. Although promising to some extent, prior techniques often memorize lexical cues as decision shortcuts, yielding low detection rate specifically for more complex submissions. As such, these classifiers do not yet reach the practical expectations of a real-time detector of security-related issues. To address these limitations, we propose SEBERTIS, a framework to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as classifiers independent of lexical cues, so that they can confidently detect fully unseen security-related issues. SEBERTIS capitalizes on fine-tuning bidirectional transformer architectures as Masked Language Models (MLMs) on a series of semantically equivalent vocabulary to prediction labels (which we call Semantic Surrogates) when they have been replaced with a mask. Our SEBERTIS-trained classifier achieves a 0.9880 F1-score in detecting security-related issues of a curated corpus of 10,000 GitHub issue reports, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art issue classifiers, with 14.44%-96.98%, 15.40%-93.07%, and 14.90%-94.72% higher detection precision, recall, and F1-score over ML-based baselines.

Camera-ready for WACV 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u56fe\u663e\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6c34\u5370\u6216\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u903c\u771f\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u6240\u6709\u6743\u548c\u6ee5\u7528\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u5927\u591a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u6c34\u5370\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u5e76\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u540e\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u57df\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5757\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u56fe\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u54ea\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6c34\u5370\u6216\u7be1\u6539\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\u4fdd\u6301\u654f\u611f\u3002\u6c34\u5370\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u3002\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6c34\u5370\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u6297\u56fe\u50cf\u88c1\u526a\u81f3\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u7be1\u6539\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we derive and evaluate a general bootstrapping outer-learning framework that improves prediction accuracy by expanding the database of human games with millions of self-playing AI games to generate and merge statistics.

Existing evaluation methods for code review generation either rely on automatic comparisons to a single ground truth, which fails to capture the variability of human perspectives, or on subjective assessments of \"usefulness\", a highly ambiguous concept. We propose a novel evaluation approach based on what we call multi-subjective ranking. Using a dataset of 280 self-contained code review requests and corresponding comments from CodeReview StackExchange, multiple human judges ranked the quality of ChatGPT-generated comments alongside the top human responses from the platform. Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers. Going further, our proposed method motivates and enables more meaningful assessments of generative AI's performance in code review, while also raising awareness of potential risks of unchecked integration into review processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4e3b\u89c2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ChatGPT\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86StackExchange\u7684\u5df2\u63a5\u53d7\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3b\u89c2\u7684\"\u6709\u7528\u6027\"\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4e3b\u89c2\u6392\u5e8f\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f7f\u7528CodeReview StackExchange\u7684280\u4e2a\u81ea\u5305\u542b\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u8bc4\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8ba9\u591a\u4f4d\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u5bf9ChatGPT\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e0e\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u9876\u7ea7\u4eba\u7c7b\u56de\u7b54\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "ChatGPT\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u8d28\u91cf\u6392\u540d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86StackExchange\u7684\u5df2\u63a5\u53d7\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4e3b\u89c2\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e0d\u52a0\u68c0\u67e5\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5ba1\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u5bf9\u5f85\u3002"}}

While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct \"brother\" relations, 2-hop for indirect \"father-son\" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a \"question-paths-answer\" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.", "AI": {"tldr": "RFKG-CoT\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bQA\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4KG-CoT\u5728WebQSP\u4e0a\u63d0\u534714.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982KG-CoT\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u50f5\u5316\u7684\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6307\u5bfc\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4LLMs\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bQA\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRFKG-CoT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5173\u7cfb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3bKG\u5173\u7cfb\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u6570\uff08\u5982\u76f4\u63a5\"\u5144\u5f1f\"\u5173\u7cfb\u75281\u8df3\uff0c\u95f4\u63a5\"\u7236\u5b50\"\u94fe\u75282\u8df3\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u63a9\u7801\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\"\u95ee\u9898-\u8def\u5f84-\u7b54\u6848\"\u683c\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aKGQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRFKG-CoT\u76f8\u6bd4KG-CoT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534714.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff08Llama2-7B\u5728WebQSP\u4e0a\uff09\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u793a\u662f\u4e92\u8865\u7684\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u5c06KG\u8bc1\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "RFKG-CoT\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bQA\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aKG\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.\n  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89c4\u907f\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u89c4\u5219\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5408\u89c4\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u4ee3\u7801\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u4f7f\u7528\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u53d7\u9650\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u6280\u672f\u524a\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u907f\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bcf\u6761\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u4ec5\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d1.5%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u89c4\u5219\u4f7f\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e10.19%\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u7834\u574f\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u8f6c\u6362\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5408\u89c4\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u524a\u5f31\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u548c\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments. Experimental results demonstrate our metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models accessing richer context are evaluated better, supporting that our protocol works as intended.

Using an OpenAPI specification, it can generate an initial input corpus consisting of sequences of requests. These are mutated with REST-specific and LibAFL-provided mutators to explore different code paths in the software under test. Guided by the measured coverage, WuppieFuzz then selects which request sequences to send next to reach complex states in the software under test. In this process, it automates harness creation to reduce manual efforts often required in fuzzing. Different kinds of reporting are provided by the fuzzer to help fixing bugs.\n  We evaluated our tool on the Petstore API to assess the robustness of the white-box approach and the effectiveness of different power schedules.

To address these issues, Machine Unlearning provides techniques to remove specific information from trained models without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating unlearning in LLMs face two major limitations: they focus only on English and support only entity-level forgetting (removing all information about a person). We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information).

We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific \"superintelligence\". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery.

This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the \"two-language problem\": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++. Overall, this toolchain allows domain experts to write compute kernels in Julia as they normally would, and then retarget them to an FPGA without additional pragmas or modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMLIR\u7684Julia\u5230SystemVerilog\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3FPGA\u4e13\u7528\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\"\u53cc\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\"\uff0c\u8ba9\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u80fd\u7528Julia\u7f16\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u6838\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210FPGA\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5411Exascale\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u6025\u5267\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u4e5f\u968f\u4e4b\u589e\u957f\u3002\u8fd9\u63a8\u52a8\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u5378\u8f7d\u5230GPU/TPU\u7b49\u901a\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528FPGA\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4e13\u7528\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\"\u53cc\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\"\uff1a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u9ad8\u7ea7\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u5185\u6838\u9700\u8981\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMLIR\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06Julia\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u5185\u6838\u7f16\u8bd1\u6210SystemVerilog\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6307\u4ee4\u6216\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9a\u5236\u3002\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9759\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0eAXI4-Stream\u534f\u8bae\u96c6\u6210\u4ee5\u8fde\u63a5\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u7247\u4e0a/\u7247\u5916\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u65e0\u5173\u7684RTL\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u7ec4\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406/\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645FPGA\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4ee5100MHz\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4ec5\u4eceC/C++\u7b49\u4f4e\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u8bd1\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u768459.71%\u523082.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u5141\u8bb8\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u50cf\u5f80\u5e38\u4e00\u6837\u7528Julia\u7f16\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7f16\u8bd1\u6307\u793a\u6216\u4fee\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5230FPGA\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e13\u7528\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework and reproducible methodology that together quantify residual risk, convert adversarial probe outcomes into financial risk estimates and return-on-control (RoC) metrics, and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses for LLM-based systems. A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (>= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83. NER redaction likewise eliminates PII leakage and attains an RoC of 5.97, while NeMo Guardrails provides only marginal benefit (RoC of 0.05).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8d22\u52a1\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u4e8e\u54ea\u4e9b\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u503c\u5f97\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8d22\u52a1\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8eDeepSeek-R1\u6a21\u578b\u7684RAG\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210PII\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Garak\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u4e94\u7c7b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6210\u529f\u6cd5\u5219\u4f30\u8ba1\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u516c\u5f00\u6cc4\u9732\u6210\u672c\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u635f\u5931\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c10,000\u6b21\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u635f\u5931\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u671f\u671b\u635f\u5931\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u5fae\u8f6fPresidio\u7684\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u8131\u654f\u3001NeMo Guardrails\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6781\u9ad8\uff08PII\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u22650.98\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u671f\u671b\u635f\u5931\u4e3a31.3\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002ABAC\u5c06PII\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0c\u603b\u671f\u671b\u635f\u5931\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea694%\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u4e3a9.83\u3002NER\u8131\u654f\u540c\u6837\u6d88\u9664\u4e86PII\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u4e3a5.97\uff0c\u800cNeMo Guardrails\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u76ca\uff08\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u73870.05\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eABAC\u548cNER\u8131\u654f\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8d22\u52a1\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u800cNeMo Guardrails\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u505a\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision.

The dataset integrates curriculum-based clinical breadth (RACGP 2022 Curriculum), epidemiologically-calibrated prevalence (BEACH study), and diverse consultation contexts. This approach systematically includes both common presentations and less-common curriculum-specified conditions that GPs must recognize but appear infrequently in single practice populations, potentially supporting more generalizable model training than datasets constrained by naturally occurring case distributions. SynGP500 is messy by design, reflecting the authentic complexity of healthcare delivery: telegraphic documentation, typos, patient non-adherence, socioeconomic barriers, and clinician-patient disagreements, unlike sanitized synthetic datasets that obscure clinical realities. Multi-faceted validation demonstrates dataset quality through epidemiological alignment with real Australian GP consultation patterns (BEACH study), stylometric analysis confirming high linguistic variation, semantic diversity analysis demonstrating broad coverage, and exploratory downstream evaluation using self-supervised medical concept extraction, showing F1 improvements.

However, harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs limit measurement methods based on traditional high-speed cameras. This paper proposes a method to measure high-frequency deformations by exploiting an event camera and LED markers. Firstly, observation noise is filtered based on the characteristics of the event stream generated by LED markers blinking and spatiotemporal correlation. Then, LED markers are extracted from the event stream after differentiating between motion-induced events and events from LED blinking, which enables the extraction of high-speed moving LED markers. Ultimately, high-frequency planar deformations are measured by a monocular event camera.

However, most existing large language models (LLMs) decouple reasoning from verification: they either generate reasoning without explicit self-checking or rely on external verifiers to detect errors post hoc. The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces, representing a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking.", "AI": {"tldr": "STC\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u6279\u5224\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u79bb\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u81ea\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4e8b\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u524d\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5373\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u589e\u52a0\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u540c\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStepwise Think-Critique (STC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u5224\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6279\u5224\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSTC\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5411\u5177\u6709\u5185\u7f6e\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "STC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u5224\u4ea4\u7ec7\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u7684AI\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5PPPO\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u524d\u7f00token\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u524d\u7f00\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5ef6\u7eed\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u751f\u6210\u7684token\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540ctoken\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5747\u5300\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u4f4e\u56de\u62a5token\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5token\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u524d\u7f00token\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5f00\u59cb\u9501\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u524d\u7f00\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u524d\u7f00token\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff1b2\uff09\u5ef6\u7eed\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u7f00token\u5e8f\u5217\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u4e2a\u5ef6\u7eed\u5e76\u7d2f\u79ef\u5176\u5206\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5956\u52b1\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPPPO\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752826.17%\u8bad\u7ec3token\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8618.02%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "PPPO\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f00\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5token\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3aRLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph.

Specifically, we propose SCALM, an LLM-powered framework featuring two methodological innovations: (1) A hybrid architecture that combines context-aware function-level slicing with knowledge-enhanced semantic reasoning via extensible vectorized pattern matching. (2) A multi-layer reasoning verification system connects low-level code patterns with high-level security principles through syntax, design patterns, and architecture analysis. Our extensive experiments using multiple LLMs and datasets have shown that SCALM outperforms existing tools in detecting bad practices in smart contracts.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCALM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e0d\u826f\u5b9e\u8df5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e0d\u826f\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6210\u719f\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ef4\u62a4\u9ad8\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7f16\u5199\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u826f\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u76f4\u63a5\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u9047\u5230\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e0d\u826f\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SCALM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7ea7\u5207\u7247\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2) \u591a\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u4f4e\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u539f\u5219\u8fde\u63a5\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSCALM\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e0d\u826f\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc747\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "SCALM\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e0d\u826f\u5b9e\u8df5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u907f\u514d\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

A multimodal encoder jointly models visual views, pose features, and semantic descriptions, which reduces cross modal discrepancy and improves identity fidelity. We further design a ResCVA module to enhance local detail while preserving global structure, and a cross modal fusion module that integrates image semantics with text throughout the denoising pipeline.

This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs achieve high-level understanding, precise extraction of experimental parameters requires domain-adapted models, providing quantitative benchmarks for scientific information extraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cb8\u77f3\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0880-90% F1\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u822c\uff0850-65% F1\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u6cb8\u77f3\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9LLMs\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\u3001\u89e6\u53d1\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u53ca\uff09\u3001\u8bba\u5143\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u53d6\uff08\u8bc6\u522b\u53c2\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\u548c\u8bba\u5143\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\uff08\u63d0\u53d6\u53c2\u6570\u503c\uff09\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u601d\uff09\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b1,530\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u53e5\u5b50\u7684ZSEE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0880-90% F1\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u822c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8bba\u5143\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u8bba\u5143\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\uff0850-65% F1\uff09\u3002GPT-5-mini\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u7aef\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0811-79% F1\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136LLMs\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u7cbe\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u9700\u8981\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5408\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

To minimize risks and impede remote compromise, sensitive systems can be physically isolated from external networks, forming an airgap. Yet, airgaps can still be infiltrated by capable adversaries gaining code execution. Prior research has shown that attackers can then attempt to wirelessly exfiltrate data across the airgap by exploiting unintended radio emissions. In this work, we demonstrate reversal of this link: malicious code execution on embedded devices can enable wireless infiltration of airgapped systems without any hardware modification. In contrast to previous infiltration methods that depend on dedicated sensors (e.g., microphones, LEDs, or temperature sensors) or require strict line-of-sight, we show that unmodified, sensor-less embedded devices can inadvertently act as radio receivers. This phenomenon stems from parasitic RF sensitivity in PCB traces and on-chip analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), allowing external transmissions to be received and decoded entirely in software.\n  Across twelve commercially available embedded devices and two custom prototypes, we observe repeatable reception in the 300-1000 MHz range, with detectable signal power as low as 1 mW. To this end, we propose a systematic methodology to identify device configurations that foster such radio sensitivities and comprehensively evaluate their feasibility for wireless data reception. Exploiting these sensitivities, we demonstrate successful data reception over tens of meters, even in non-line-of-sight conditions and show that the reception sensitivities accommodate data rates of up to 100 kbps. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored command-and-control vector for air-gapped systems while challenging assumptions about their inherent isolation.

While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \\textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics.

Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns. This dissociation between apparent robustness and real vulnerability exposes deep limitations in current alignment regimes. The absence of evaluations in Portuguese, a language with high morphosyntactic complexity, a rich metric-prosodic tradition, and over 250 million speakers, constitutes a critical gap.

However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers. We propose a Precision-Focused (BCE) loss function that penalizes FPs to meet the requirements of safety-critical vehicular systems. Extensive evaluation across 4 platoon controllers, multiple attack vectors, and diverse mobility scenarios demonstrates superior performance ($\\geq$ 0.93) compared to state-of-the-art baseline architectures. A comprehensive deployment analysis utilizing TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and TensorRT achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for real-time operation on resource-constrained edge platforms.

However, current approaches employ uniform language density for both intermediate reasoning and final answers, leading to computational inefficiency. Our observation found that reasoning process serves a computational function for the model itself, while answering serves a communicative function for human understanding. This distinction enables the use of compressed, symbol-rich language for intermediate computations while maintaining human-readable final explanations. To address this inefficiency, we present Denser: \\underline{D}ual-d\\underline{ens}ity inf\\underline{er}ence, a novel framework that optimizes information density separately for reasoning and answering phases. Our framework implements this through three components: a query processing module that analyzes input problems, a high-density compressed reasoning mechanism for efficient intermediate computations, and an answer generation component that translates compressed reasoning into human-readable solutions. Experimental evaluation across multiple reasoning question answering benchmarks demonstrates that Denser reduces token consumption by up to 62\\% compared to standard Chain-of-Thought methods while preserving or improving accuracy.

However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

However, these models are increasingly vulnerable to leakage and theft, highlighting the critical need for robust intellectual property protection. Model watermarking has emerged as an effective solution, with black-box watermarking gaining significant attention for its practicality and flexibility. Nonetheless, existing black-box methods often fail to better balance covertness (hiding the watermark to prevent detection and forgery) and robustness (ensuring the watermark resists removal)-two essential properties for real-world copyright verification. In this paper, we propose ComMark, a novel black-box model watermarking framework that leverages frequency-domain transformations to generate compressed, covert, and attack-resistant watermark samples by filtering out high-frequency information. To further enhance watermark robustness, our method incorporates simulated attack scenarios and a similarity loss during training. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that ComMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covertness and robustness.

Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u673a\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(MI-LLMs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GPT-4\u5c06\u4e2d\u6587\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aMI\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u4e2d\u6587LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9eMI\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08(MI)\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u54a8\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u5e7f\u53d7\u5230\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u54a8\u8be2\u5e08\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u673a\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u6536\u96c6\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e2d\u6587\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4\u548cMI\u63d0\u793a\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u6700\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6(CPsyCounD\u548cPsyDTCorpus)\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a2,040\u4e2aMI\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e2d\u6587\u5f00\u6e90LLM(Baichuan2-7B-Chat\u3001ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat\u548cLlama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2)\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5f62\u6210MI-LLMs\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u6b21\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u7801(\u4f7f\u7528MITI\u7f16\u7801\u624b\u518c4.2.1)\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684BLEU-4\u548cROUGE\u5206\u6570\u3002\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u663e\u793aMI-LLMs\u5728\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u5168\u5c40\u8bc4\u5206\u4ee5\u53caMI\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9eMI\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u53cd\u601d-\u95ee\u9898\u6bd4\u7387\u4ecd\u7136\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "MI\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u901a\u7528LLM\u5177\u5907\u6838\u5fc3\u7684MI\u4e00\u81f4\u54a8\u8be2\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u5065\u5eb7\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u590d\u6742MI\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e72\u9884\u8bd5\u9a8c\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Our study pioneers sentiment analysis in Bangla during a national crisis by examining public emotions amid Bangladesh's 2024 mass uprising. We curated a unique dataset of 2,028 annotated news headlines from major Facebook news portals, classifying them into Outrage, Hope, and Despair. Through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified prevalent themes like political corruption and public protests, and analyzed how events such as internet blackouts shaped sentiment patterns. It outperformed multilingual transformers (mBERT: 67%, XLM-RoBERTa: 71%) and traditional machine learning methods (SVM and Logistic Regression: both 70%). These results highlight the effectiveness of language-specific models and offer valuable insights into public sentiment during political turmoil.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u57282024\u5e74\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6297\u8bae\u671f\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b2028\u6761\u6807\u6ce8\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u5728\u9009\u4e3e\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u8d8b\u52bf\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u56fd\u5bb6\u5371\u673a\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u516c\u4f17\u60c5\u7eea\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd2024\u5e74\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6297\u8bae\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u516c\u4f17\u60c5\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981Facebook\u65b0\u95fb\u95e8\u6237\u76842028\u6761\u6807\u6ce8\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u6124\u6012\u3001\u5e0c\u671b\u548c\u7edd\u671b\u4e09\u7c7b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u5206\u914d\uff08LDA\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3b\u9898\uff08\u5982\u653f\u6cbb\u8150\u8d25\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u6297\u8bae\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5c01\u9501\u7b49\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff08mBERT\u3001XLM-RoBERTa\uff09\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SVM\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff08mBERT\uff1a67%\uff0cXLM-RoBERTa\uff1a71%\uff09\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SVM\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\uff1a\u5747\u4e3a70%\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u653f\u6cbb\u8150\u8d25\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u6297\u8bae\u7b49\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5c01\u9501\u7b49\u4e8b\u4ef6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u6790\u5371\u673a\u671f\u95f4\u516c\u4f17\u60c5\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u653f\u6cbb\u52a8\u8361\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u516c\u4f17\u60c5\u7eea\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u5728\u5371\u673a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "CTKVR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684centroid-then-token KV\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff09\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001KV\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u5757\u7ea7\u7d22\u5f15\u4f1a\u56e0\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173KV\u6761\u76ee\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u7d22\u5f15\u5219\u56e0\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u4f4e\u6548\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "CTKVR\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d28\u5fc3\u7528\u4e8e\u8d28\u5fc3\u7c92\u5ea6\u7d22\u5f15\uff1b2\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u7ec6\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684KV\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u89c2\u5bdf\uff1a\u7ecf\u8fc7RoPE\u540e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5411\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5171\u4eab\u5927\u90e8\u5206top-k KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6761\u76ee\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7CPU-GPU\u534f\u540c\u6267\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u7d22\u5f15\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCTKVR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u572896K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9Llama-3-8B\u548cYi-9B\u6a21\u578b\uff0cCTKVR\u5728\u4e0d\u540cGPU\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863\u500d\u548c4\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "CTKVR\u901a\u8fc7centroid-then-token\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects - a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation.

Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets.

Many of the inherent difficulties in these tasks stem from Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), which complicate the tasks by introducing ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, infrequent usage, and a wide range of variations. Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation (NMT). Furthermore, we report experiments to examine how Chinese character decomposition technology contributes to the representation of the original meanings of Chinese words and characters, and how it can effectively address the challenges of translating MWEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6c49\u5b57\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u5728MWE\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6c49\u5b57\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u6587\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u5b57\u7b26\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8bcd\u8868\u8fbe\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bcd\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5904\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u8bf8\u591a\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5982\u6b67\u4e49\u3001\u4e60\u8bed\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u4f4e\u9891\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u53d8\u4f53\u591a\u6837\u7b49\u3002\u867d\u7136\u897f\u65b9\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u5728MWE\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u6587\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u4e9a\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u76f8\u5bf9\u6ede\u540e\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6c49\u5b57\u662f\u8868\u610f\u6587\u5b57\uff0c\u897f\u65b9\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982BPE\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728MWE\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6c49\u5b57\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8003\u5bdf\u6c49\u5b57\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u5e2e\u52a9\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u6587\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u5b57\u7b26\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u8bcd\u8868\u8fbe\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6c49\u5b57\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e2d\u6587MWE\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8bcd\u8868\u8fbe\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6c49\u5b57\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u6587\u591a\u8bcd\u8868\u8fbe\u7ffb\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4e2d\u6587\u5728MWE\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u6587\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In contrast to prior research on byte-level LMs, which focuses predominantly on training from scratch, we train Bolmo by byteifying existing subword-level LMs. Byteification enables overcoming the limitations of subword tokenization - such as insufficient character understanding and efficiency constraints due to the fixed subword vocabulary - while performing at the level of leading subword-level LMs. Bolmo is specifically designed for byteification: our architecture resolves a mismatch between the expressivity of prior byte-level architectures and subword-level LMs, which makes it possible to employ an effective exact distillation objective between Bolmo and the source subword model. This allows for converting a subword-level LM to a byte-level LM by investing less than 1\\% of a typical pretraining token budget. Bolmo substantially outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, and outperforms the source subword-level LMs on character understanding and, in some cases, coding, while coming close to matching the original LMs' performance on other tasks. Furthermore, we show that Bolmo can achieve inference speeds competitive with subword-level LMs by training with higher token compression ratios, and can be cheaply and effectively post-trained by leveraging the existing ecosystem around the source subword-level LM. Our results finally make byte-level LMs a practical choice competitive with subword-level LMs across a wide set of use cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bolmo\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57281B\u548c7B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u8282\u5316\u73b0\u6709\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u9886\u5148\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b57\u7b26\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6548\u7387\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5b57\u7b26\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u514b\u670d\u5b50\u8bcd\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\"\u5b57\u8282\u5316\"\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u7684Bolmo\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u84b8\u998f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u4e0d\u52301%\u7684\u5178\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u7b97\u5c31\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "Bolmo\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u5148\u524d\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5b57\u7b26\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u67d0\u4e9b\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6e90\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u9ad8\u6807\u8bb0\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5ec9\u4ef7\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "Bolmo\u4f7f\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u8282\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

While existing methods achieve promising results in the camera coordinate system by assuming zero camera rotation, this simplification leads to significant errors when transforming the reconstructed mesh to the world coordinate system. To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose.

The corpus contains 200 dialogues and 4709 utterances, including 2336 help seeker turns, with labeling and Cohen's kappa 0.639. In a counterbalanced study, the co-pilot reduced average annotation time by 22.4%. In expert review, it averaged 4.62 for evidence, 4.44 for clinical plausibility, and 4.40 for insight on a seven-point scale. Benchmarks with strong language models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate clear headroom, with the best macro F1-score around 30% and a tendency to overpredict mature defenses.

This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u6307\u6807\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f4e\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u529b\u74f6\u9888\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2dLLM\u4f1a\u51fa\u9519\u3002\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7fLLM\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8eLLM\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528LLM-as-Judges\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u65f6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u6307\u6807\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f4e\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u867d\u7136\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u8bb8\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u6307\u6807\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u9519\u8bef\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u89e6\u53d1\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u6307\u6807\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e6\u53d1\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7fLLM\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u6216\u56fe\u57fa\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u58f0\u660e\u3002"}}

Existing methods perform low-rank adaptation over the full parameter space. However, fine-tuning within a subspace can achieve comparable effectiveness. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained models possess non-trivial null spaces, we propose Null-space based Low-Rank Adaptation (Null-LoRA). Null-LoRA effectively reduces redundancy and enhances effective rank by freezing portions of the low-rank matrices. To further improve parameter efficiency, Null-LoRA constrains the entire incremental update within the null space, maximizing the utilization of incremental updates to adapt to new task paradigms.

Full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are two dominant approaches. While PEFT methods are widely used for their computational efficiency, the implications of their configurations (e.g., rank) remain under-explored in downstream Q&A tasks and generalisation. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting. We demonstrate that LoRA achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values.

Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $\u0394$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $\u0394$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCMAC-MMD\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u53c9\u60a3\u8005\u4e9a\u7ec4\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u654f\u611f\u4eba\u53e3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u548c\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u60a3\u8005\u4e9a\u7ec4\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f0f\u8bca\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u6574\u4f53\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD)\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4ea4\u53c9\u60a3\u8005\u4e9a\u7ec4\u95f4\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u654f\u611f\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5747\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6f0f\u8bca\u7387\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece0.50\u964d\u81f30.26\uff0cAUC\u4ece0.94\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.97\uff1b\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6f0f\u8bca\u7387\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece0.41\u964d\u81f30.31\uff0cAUC\u4ece0.71\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.72\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u90fd\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CMAC-MMD\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60a3\u8005\u4e9a\u7ec4\u95f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e13\u7528\u8ba1\u6570\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0VLMs\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8ba1\u6570\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u8ba1\u6570\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u7269\u4f53\u8ba1\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u8ba1\u6570\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570VLMs\u80fd\u591f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u679a\u4e3e\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e13\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5f53\u63d0\u793aVLMs\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5f85\u8ba1\u6570\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u679a\u4e3e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136VLMs\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u7269\u4f53\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8ba1\u6570\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks.

To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity.

Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4.

While recent approaches have leveraged generative models to augment existing data, they remain dependent on real world training samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel direction, Zero Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (ZSWSSS), and propose SynthSeg Agents, a multi agent framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data entirely without real images. SynthSeg Agents comprises two key modules, a Self Refine Prompt Agent and an Image Generation Agent. The Self Refine Prompt Agent autonomously crafts diverse and semantically rich image prompts via iterative refinement, memory mechanisms, and prompt space exploration, guided by CLIP based similarity and nearest neighbor diversity filtering. These prompts are then passed to the Image Generation Agent, which leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize candidate images. A frozen CLIP scoring model is employed to select high quality samples, and a ViT based classifier is further trained to relabel the entire synthetic dataset with improved semantic precision. Our framework produces high quality training data without any real image supervision. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 show that SynthSeg Agents achieves competitive performance without using real training images.

Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity.

A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\uff08VTC\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u957f\u6587\u672c\u540e\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\uff08VTC\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u957f\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u76842D\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b03x-20x\u7684token\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9VLMs\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9996\u4e2aVTC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u573a\u666f\uff1aVTC-Retrieval\uff08\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\uff09\u3001VTC-Reasoning\uff08\u63a8\u65ad\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u8054\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff09\u3001VTC-Memory\uff08\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u7acbVTCBench-Wild\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u591a\u6570VLMs\u80fd\u591f\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u7801\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982OCR\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728VTC\u538b\u7f29\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u5dee\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5173\u8054\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9VTC\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684VLMs\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO.

And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation.

Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots. However, existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, hindering temporal coherence across turns. We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, while a lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability. Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show that TIMAR reduces Fr\u00e9chet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data.

In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an \"Expand-and-Prune\" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs.

The dataset comprises high-resolution 3D scans of a diverse range of bridge structures from various countries, with detailed semantic labels provided for each. Our initial objective is to facilitate accurate and automated segmentation of bridge components, thereby advancing the structural health monitoring practice. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing 3D deep learning models on this novel dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of three distinct state-of-the-art architectures.

Despite significant advances in player and ball tracking, pose estimation, action localization, and automatic foul recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received comparatively little attention. This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios.

We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings. These results show that lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning.

We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion.

Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Results on new benchmarks, including in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirm its robustness and scalability.

Gee"], "title": "The LUMirage: An independent evaluation of zero-shot performance in the LUMIR challenge", "comment": null, "summary": "The LUMIR challenge represents an important benchmark for evaluating deformable image registration methods on large-scale neuroimaging data. While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9LUMIR\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u5173\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u72ec\u7acb\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185T1\u52a0\u6743MRI\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "LUMIR\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u58f0\u79f0\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u65e2\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u58f0\u660e\u8fdb\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4eea\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185T1\u52a0\u6743MRI\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2) \u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd1\u4eb2\u7269\u79cd\uff08\u7315\u7334\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b3) \u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\uff08T2\u3001T2*\u3001FLAIR\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b4) \u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1b5) \u5bf9\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185T1\u52a0\u6743\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7315\u7334\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b2) \u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cCohen's d\u5206\u6570\u57280.7-1.5\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3) \u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\uff080.6mm\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ece\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\uff1b4) \u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u65e2\u5b9a\u6587\u732e\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\"\u901a\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\"\u58f0\u660e\u9700\u8981\u4ed4\u7ec6\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u4e3b\u5f20\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u504f\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Modern generative models can produce visually consistent forgeries that evade traditional detectors based on pixel or compression artefacts. Most existing approaches also lack an explicit measure of anomaly intensity, which limits their ability to quantify the severity of manipulation. This paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a novel dual-module framework that integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers (ViT) with patch-level self-consistency scoring derived from SegFormer embeddings. The hybrid formulation provides a continuous and interpretable anomaly score that reflects both the location and degree of manipulation. Evaluations on the DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets demonstrate that VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance, while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps.

Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation. However, none of these diffusion models realizes high-fidelity disentangled control between the head pose and facial expression, hindering applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation. To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency.

Yu Zhou"], "title": "EmoCaliber: Advancing Reliable Visual Emotion Comprehension via Confidence Verbalization and Calibration", "comment": null, "summary": "Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems.

To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval.

We propose BLANKET (Baby-face Landmark-preserving ANonymization with Keypoint dEtection consisTency), a novel approach designed to anonymize infant faces in video recordings while preserving essential facial attributes. Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts.

However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAM3\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76d1\u7763\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SAM3\u6982\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0d\u540c\u76d1\u7763\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5", "result": "\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5f62\u72b6\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u8f7b\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u80fd-\u52aa\u529b\u6743\u8861", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6807\u6ce8\u52aa\u529b\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\uff1b\u9065\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6b20\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4ecd\u662f\u666e\u904d\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u8f83\u5c11\u89c1\u76ee\u6807"}}

Includes supplementary material", "summary": "High-performance Radar-Camera 3D object detection can be achieved by leveraging knowledge distillation without using LiDAR at inference time. However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation.

A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations.

In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose \\textbf{Qwen-Image-Layered}, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling \\textbf{inherent editability}, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6807\u5b9a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316SfM\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u589e\u91cf\u6dfb\u52a0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f3a\u5f84\u5411\u7578\u53d8\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u7ed3\u6784\u4ece\u8fd0\u52a8\uff08SfM\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u5185\u5916\u53c2\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5f84\u5411\u7578\u53d8\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u4f73\u5730\u4ece\u5bc6\u96c6\u5339\u914d\u5668\u4e2d\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u70b9\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2) \u7814\u7a76\u589e\u91cf\u6dfb\u52a0\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6807\u51c6\uff1b3) \u5728\u5168\u5c40SfM\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u5e94\u70b9\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528VGGT\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4f4d\u59ff\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5f84\u5411\u7578\u53d8\u76f8\u673a\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u523079.9%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u539f\u59cbVGGT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4e3a40.4%\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u76f8\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316SfM\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6cd5\u533b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e9a\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u9006\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u96f7\u8fbe(ISAR)\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u536b\u661f\u5916\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8fd1\u5730\u7a7a\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a7b\u7559\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u4f53(RSOs)\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u83b7\u53d6\u5176\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a7a\u95f4\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5(SDA)\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u66f4\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u4e0d\u53d7\u5927\u6c14\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u5168\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5bf9RSOs\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e9a\u592a\u8d6b\u5179ISAR\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\uff1a1)\u4f7f\u7528\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210ISAR\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2)\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u521d\u59cb\u5e27\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b3)\u91c7\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b4)\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u52a0\u6743\u970d\u592b\u53d8\u6362\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff1b5)\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7279\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728ISAR\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe100\u516c\u91cc\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4e9a\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9634\u5f71\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u7528\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684ISAR\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u536b\u661f\u5916\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: \"what would happen given a specific future action\". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation.

They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance. Through our proposed evaluation, we demonstrate existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models, with current limitations being prohibitive of scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications", "AI": {"tldr": "AllSky\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u6355\u83b7\u7684HDRI\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u5168\u5929\u5019\u5929\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u592a\u9633\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u4e91\u5c42\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5929\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709DNN\u5929\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5929\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fe0\u5b9e\u518d\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u5929\u7a7a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cDNN\u751f\u6210\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5730\u56fe\u65e0\u6cd5\u50cf\u7269\u7406\u6355\u83b7\u7684HDRI\u90a3\u6837\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u4eae\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u6237\u5916\u7167\u660e\u6240\u9700\u768422\u6863\u5b8c\u6574\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAllSky\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u6355\u83b7\u7684HDRI\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8272\u8c03\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u76f4\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\u592a\u9633\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u4e91\u5c42\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "AllSky\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5929\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u73b0\u6709DNN\u5929\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u6355\u83b7\u7684HDRI\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5929\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\u4e92\u6362\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u9650\u5236\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7167\u660e\u3002", "conclusion": "AllSky\u5728HDR\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5929\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5730\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6237\u5916\u573a\u666f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6e32\u67d3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faInpaintDPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684DPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u524d\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u80cc\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5171\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd0\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInpaintDPO\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) MaskDPO\u5c06\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u9650\u5236\u5728\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2) \u6761\u4ef6\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u88c1\u526a\u64cd\u4f5c\u589e\u5f3a\u8fb9\u754c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b3) \u5171\u4eab\u5171\u6027\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5171\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u524d\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5143\u7d20\u4e4b\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u548c\u8c10\u5ea6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "InpaintDPO\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u524d\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684DPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80cc\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5171\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002"}}

However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Our findings re-establish the importance of hard labels as a complementary tool, and call for a rethinking of their role in soft-label-dominated training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faHALD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u6765\u6821\u51c6\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u88c1\u526a\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u53ea\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u65f6\uff0c\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u88c1\u526a\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u8f6f\u5d4c\u5165\u504f\u79bb\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHALD\uff08Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u6821\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5c11\u91cf\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u8f6f\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e38\u89c4\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5728ImageNet-1K\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528285M\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u5c31\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8642.7%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LPLD\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e869.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u91cd\u65b0\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u5728\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002HALD\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations.

To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query.

They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications.

We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks.

However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup.
