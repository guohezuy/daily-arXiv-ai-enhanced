### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training的新方法，通过在适配器训练期间为混淆因素提供显式捷径，防止适配器学习到目标属性与偶然因素（如姿势、表情、光照）的虚假相关性，从而提高生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的适配器训练方法在从单张图像中学习目标属性（如身份）时，容易将目标属性与图像中的偶然因素（如姿势、表情、光照）纠缠在一起，这种虚假相关性限制了模型的泛化能力和对文本提示的遵循能力。

Method: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，在适配器训练期间通过ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块为混淆因素提供显式捷径，消除适配器学习这些因素的动力，然后在推理时移除这些辅助模块。

Result: 在面部和全身身份注入等任务中，该方法显著提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，当寻求解耦表示时，最有效的路径可能是为不应学习的内容建立捷径，这是一个通用的设计原则。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 是一种新的视频生成范式，通过使用参考视频作为语义提示，在冻结的视频扩散变换器上实现统一、可泛化的语义控制，无需特定条件微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化语义控制的挑战，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的特定条件微调或任务特定架构。

Method: 提出VAP范式，将参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过即插即用的混合变换器专家引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，采用时间偏置位置嵌入消除虚假映射先验。

Result: VAP在开源方法中达到最新水平，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，可与领先的特定条件商业模型相媲美，并构建了包含10万对视频的VAP-Data数据集。

Conclusion: VAP的强零样本泛化能力和对各种下游应用的支持，标志着向通用可控视频生成的重要进展。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT是一个生成式点轨迹跟踪框架，通过流匹配方法建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡情况下能捕捉轨迹的多模态性，在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前判别式点跟踪模型在不确定性情况下只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉多模态轨迹的问题。

Method: 提出生成式点跟踪器(GenPT)，采用流匹配方法结合判别式跟踪器的迭代细化、跨窗口一致性的窗口依赖先验，以及针对点坐标调整的方差调度。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，特别是在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进精度，同时在可见点上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态性，在遮挡点跟踪方面优于现有判别式点跟踪器，同时保持对可见点的竞争性跟踪精度。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [4] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了3DReasonKnee，这是首个用于医学图像的3D基础推理数据集，包含494k个高质量五元组，支持视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中进行解剖区域定位和逐步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中难以对解剖区域进行定位并以逐步方式推理，这是真实世界诊断评估的关键要求。现有3D数据集提供定位标签但不支持这种"基础推理"能力。

Method: 创建3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本包括：3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、定位相关解剖结构的3D边界框、临床医生生成的详细3D推理步骤以及相关解剖区域的结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，对五种最先进的视觉语言模型进行基准测试，为ReasonKnee-Bench提供基线性能。数据集经过450多个小时的专家临床医生时间验证，确保高质量和临床相关性。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的独特资源库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐、局部化决策能力发展提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建方法受限于光照和材料特性，无法有效处理透明、半透明和异质物体。热偏振成像能够克服这些限制，提供更准确的形状重建。

Method: 提出基于多视角热偏振图像的3D形状重建方法，利用长波红外偏振成像技术，建立了偏振观测的一般理论框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了一种独立于光照和材料特性的有效方法，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的物体类型。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [6] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的无监督自适应方法，通过多视角物体中心视频对视觉基础模型进行自监督微调，无需标注即可适应新领域，在分布偏移和标签稀缺场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标签稀缺领域表现不佳，而生成语言模型常用的持续自监督学习策略在视觉编码器模型中效果有限，因此需要开发有效的无监督自适应方法。

Method: 采用自蒸馏范式，利用多视角物体中心视频进行自监督微调，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效自适应技术，防止模型遗忘预训练知识。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前自适应方法取得了一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: VESSA提供了一种有效的无监督视觉基础模型自适应方法，能够利用多视角物体观测学习对多样化捕获条件的鲁棒性，无需标注即可提升模型性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

*Jiaqi Hu,Hongli Xu,Junwen Huang,Peter KT Yu,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于工业环境中未见物体2D检测的标准化即插即用流程，通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的背景去除来减少域偏移和背景伪影，显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流程在复杂工业环境下性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈，需要解决在杂乱、光照差和复杂背景等挑战条件下的检测问题。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，采用低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出的假阳性，为下游姿态估计提供更可靠的检测结果。

Result: 在真实工业拣选基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升检测精度，同时推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法在工业环境中具有有效性和实用性，能够显著提升未见物体的检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个基于深度学习的混合框架，用于在地震后自动检测混凝土结构中暴露的钢筋，从而评估结构损伤程度。该方法结合了YOLOv11模型进行裂缝、剥落和钢筋检测，以及另一个YOLO模型进行损伤等级分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震后及时评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要。暴露钢筋的数量和分布是结构损伤和退化的指标，需要自动化检测方法。

Method: 使用2023年土耳其地震后收集的图像数据集，采用深度学习框架，通过微调、数据增强和公开数据集测试。开发了自动分类框架识别建筑物内外和结构构件，训练YOLOv11模型检测裂缝、剥落和暴露钢筋，微调另一个YOLO模型区分不同结构损伤等级。

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了利用图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，在灾害后实现跨不同损伤背景的快速自动化损伤检测是可行的。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D是一个零样本3D场景图生成框架，利用预训练基础模型实现开放词汇识别，生成丰富的语义场景表示，支持增量更新和3D几何接地，适用于机器人应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视图、不支持增量更新、缺乏3D空间几何接地的问题，这些对于具身场景至关重要。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其接地到3D空间。节点表示具有特征、3D位置和语义上下文的开放词汇对象，边捕获空间和语义关系及物体间距离。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本3D场景图生成，支持开放词汇识别、增量更新和3D几何接地，为下游机器人应用提供了合适的场景表示。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合专家文本概念和视觉语言模型的框架，用于先天性巨结肠症中神经丛分类，通过整合医学专业知识指导深度学习模型，在分类性能上优于传统CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在神经丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且与医生决策方式不符，需要开发能够整合临床专业知识的多模态学习方法。

Method: 使用基于对比语言-图像预训练的视觉语言模型，整合专家来源的文本概念（医学教科书和论文），通过大型语言模型生成提示并经团队审核，使用QuiltNet编码，将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 提出的模型在各项分类指标上均优于基于CNN的模型（VGG-19、ResNet-18、ResNet-50），准确率达到83.9%，精确度86.6%，特异性87.6%。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有巨大潜力，整合专家知识能够产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型（HistRetinex），通过将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，实现快速低光照图像增强，在保持良好视觉效果的同时显著提升处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Retinex的低光照图像增强方法在处理大尺寸图像时耗时较长，需要开发更高效的算法来提升处理速度。

Method: 定义直方图位置矩阵和直方图计数矩阵，建立光照、反射率和低光照图像直方图之间的关系；构建两级优化模型，通过求解优化模型得到光照直方图和反射率直方图的迭代公式；通过直方图匹配实现图像增强。

Result: 实验结果表明，HistRetinex在可见性和性能指标上优于现有增强方法，在1000*664分辨率图像上仅需1.86秒执行时间，比现有方法至少节省6.67秒。

Conclusion: HistRetinex模型通过直方图域的处理实现了快速高效的低光照图像增强，在保持增强质量的同时显著提升了处理速度。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了主动视觉推理(AVR)任务，将视觉推理扩展到部分可观察的交互环境中，要求智能体通过物理动作主动获取信息、整合多步观察并动态调整决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的视觉推理主要局限于静态、完全可观察的环境，而现实世界信息往往因遮挡或有限视野而不完整。受人类主动探索环境能力的启发，需要开发能够主动获取和整合信息的视觉推理系统。

Method: 提出了CLEVR-AVR模拟基准和AVR-152k大规模数据集，包含丰富的思维链标注。开发了PhysVLM-AVR多模态大语言模型，在更高阶马尔可夫决策过程中训练智能体进行不确定性识别、信息增益预测和信息最大化动作选择。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理(OpenEQA, RoboVQA)和被动视觉推理(GeoMath, Geometry30K)任务上达到最先进性能。分析显示当前具身MLLM虽然能检测信息不完整性，但在通过交互主动获取和整合新信息方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是视觉推理的重要扩展方向，当前模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要进一步研究如何让智能体像人类一样主动探索环境以获取和整合信息。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，仅改变与安全策略相关的特征，从而翻转图像的安全标签，同时保持安全无关细节不变，构建反事实图像对。

Result: 构建了包含3020张SafetyPair图像的新安全基准，涵盖9个安全类别，发现该框架能有效暴露视觉语言模型在区分细微差异图像方面的弱点，并可作为数据增强策略提高轻量级防护模型的训练效率。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs框架为研究细粒度图像安全区分提供了首个系统资源，既能作为评估基准，又能作为数据增强工具，显著提升了模型对图像安全性的理解能力。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

*Longtian Qiu,Shan Ning,Jiaxuan Sun,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisyGRPO是一个多模态强化学习框架，通过注入高斯噪声到视觉输入来增强探索，并使用贝叶斯框架建模优势估计，以提升多模态大语言模型的链式思维推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习框架在提升通用链式思维推理时，往往难以泛化到训练分布之外。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够增强探索和鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 提出NoisyGRPO框架，包含两个关键组件：1）噪声注入探索策略：在视觉输入中添加可控高斯噪声以鼓励更广泛的视觉场景探索；2）贝叶斯优势估计：将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推理问题，融合噪声水平和轨迹奖励信息来计算稳健的后验优势估计。

Result: 在标准链式思维质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中，NoisyGRPO显著提高了泛化性和鲁棒性，特别是在使用小规模MLLM（如Qwen2.5-VL 3B）的强化学习设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性的噪声注入和贝叶斯优势估计，有效提升了多模态大语言模型在链式思维推理任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为小规模模型的强化学习训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于CycleGAN的级联合成器方法，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA，旨在减少对碘对比剂的依赖和相关风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTPA依赖碘对比剂，存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是在高危患者中。研究旨在开发一种无需对比剂即可生成高质量CTPA图像的方法。

Method: 使用基于Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN)的级联合成器，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA。研究使用了来自三个中心的410对CTPA和NCCT扫描进行训练和验证。

Result: 该方法在定量指标上表现最佳（验证集MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71, SSIM: 0.98；测试集MAE: 165.12, PSNR: 20.27, SSIM: 0.98），在下游任务中，肺动脉和静脉分割的Dice、clDice和clRecall分别为0.70、0.71、0.73和0.70、0.72、0.75，血管体积的ICC为0.81，显著优于NCCT。

Conclusion: 提出的DCCTPA方法能够有效增强血管，特别是小血管，在减少对比剂使用风险的同时保持了图像质量和结构完整性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

*Qihang Zhou,Binbin Gao,Guansong Pang,Xin Wang,Jiming Chen,Shibo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个基于CLIP的零样本异常检测框架，通过动态视觉-文本空间对齐实现细粒度异常学习，相比现有方法具有更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一文本空间来对齐不同物体和领域的视觉语义，这种无差别的对齐方式难以准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 提出TokenCLIP框架，将视觉token动态分配到正交文本子空间的组合中，通过最优传输问题建模动态对齐，并使用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性能。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态视觉-文本空间对齐实现了更有效的零样本异常检测，能够更好地捕捉多样化异常语义。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准存在数据污染和饱和风险，导致性能评估失真，需要更可靠的评估协议。

Method: 使用图表示VQA样本，通过知识增强基准演化框架，重构问题并整合外部知识，实现难度可控的评估。

Result: 实验表明KBE有效缓解数据污染和饱和风险，提供更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法，解决了静态基准的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦策略成功实现了高质量3D网格生成，在效率和精度方面都表现出色，为3D内容创作提供了有力工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，无法满足视觉语言导航的需求。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D框架，包含两个组件：(1) 对象中心语义标注，为3DGS添加对象级细粒度标注；(2) 物理感知执行连接，在3DGS中嵌入碰撞对象并构建丰富的物理接口。

Result: 发布了包含1K对象标注3DGS室内场景数据的InteriorGS，以及首个基于3DGS的VLN基准SAGE-Bench（含2M VLN数据）。实验显示3DGS场景数据更难收敛但泛化性强，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上提升基线性能31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为语义和物理对齐的可执行环境，为视觉语言导航提供了更有效的工具，显著提升了导航性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了多模态大语言模型在高分辨率场景中处理极小物体的挑战，通过两阶段强化学习方法实现了更好的推理和分割性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

*Anupam Pani,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种仅在训练时使用眼动注视的视觉语言模型正则化框架，通过注视正则化注意力机制将模型关注与人类视觉注视对齐，显著提升自我中心视角下的细粒度未来事件预测和当前活动理解任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼动注视提供了关于注意力、短期意图和未来行动的宝贵线索，是建模自我中心行为的强大信号。现有方法要么仅依赖视觉输入，要么将注视作为辅助输入信号，而本工作探索仅在训练时使用注视来增强视觉语言模型。

Method: 提出注视正则化框架，引入注视正则化注意力机制，使模型关注与人类视觉注视对齐。该方法设计灵活模块化，可推广到多种使用注意力的视觉语言模型架构，且仅在训练时使用注视信号。

Result: 实验结果显示，相比未使用注视正则化的基线模型，该方法在未来事件预测任务中语义预测分数提升高达11分，在当前活动理解任务中提升约7分。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了注视引导训练在提高自我中心视觉语言模型准确性和鲁棒性方面的价值，为在辅助机器人和人机协作等现实场景中使用人类注视增强视觉语言模型预测能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

### [28] [Why Registration Quality Matters: Enhancing sCT Synthesis with IMPACT-Based Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21358)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的合成CT生成管道，使用2.5D U-Net++架构，结合IMPACT-Synth感知损失和两种配准策略（Elastix和IMPACT），在SynthRAD2025挑战赛中实现了从MRI和CBCT生成合成CT的目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差对监督学习的影响，开发更稳健和可泛化的模型，减少解剖结构失真。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练各解剖区域并进行区域微调。损失函数结合像素级L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失。采用AdamW优化器，基于补丁的归一化输入，测试时使用数据增强和五折集成。评估两种配准策略：Elastix（互信息）和IMPACT（基于特征的相似性度量）。

Result: 在本地测试集上，基于IMPACT的配准实现了比互信息配准更准确和解剖一致的配准，导致合成CT生成具有更低的MAE和更真实的解剖结构。在公共验证集上，使用Elastix配准数据的模型得分更高，反映了与评估管道一致的配准策略偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估，可能以牺牲解剖保真度为代价来提升性能指标。通过促进解剖一致的配准，IMPACT有助于减轻这种偏差，支持开发更稳健和可泛化的合成CT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

Conclusion: TerraGen通过统一的布局到图像生成框架解决了遥感视觉任务中数据增强的局限性，实现了空间可控的多任务图像合成，为遥感分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 解决图像拼接中因物体深度变化导致的大视差问题，避免拼接结果出现重影和错位现象。

Method: 1. 多阶段机制结合全局深度正则化约束增强不同深度范围内相同表观目标的对齐精度；2. 通过图基低代价计算确定最佳拼接缝，扩散软缝区域精确定位过渡区域；3. 引入重参数化策略优化结构设计。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法相比现有方法具有优越性能，能有效减轻视差引起的对齐误差，实现自然无缝的拼接结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度一致性约束和优化策略，成功解决了大视差环境下的图像拼接问题，在保持最优性能的同时显著提高了算法效率。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Motivation: 为长视频平台开发实用的视频检索系统，解决未剪辑视频和多模态查询的处理挑战，满足用户对细粒度检索的需求。

Method: 构建MUVR基准，包含三个版本（Base、Filter、QA），支持长文本描述、视频标签提示和掩码提示等多模态查询，建立基于核心视频内容的多层次视觉对应关系。

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的语言基础视觉概念学习框架，能够自适应识别图像相关概念轴并在真实场景中沿这些轴进行视觉概念定位，无需预定义概念轴。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言基础视觉概念学习方法局限于少数预定义基本轴（如颜色、形状），且通常在合成数据集上探索，无法处理真实世界中丰富多样的语义维度。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别多样化图像相关轴；通过通用概念编码器自适应绑定视觉特征到发现轴；优化组合锚定目标确保各轴可独立操作。

Result: 在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ数据集上展示了优越的编辑能力，能够处理过于多样化而无法手动预定义的真实世界概念，并表现出强大的组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉概念学习和基于文本的编辑方法中表现优异，为处理真实世界多样化视觉概念提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

Motivation: 现有方法在合成关节化3D物体时难以同时保证几何一致性、准确关节和逼真外观，特别是在处理关节依赖的可见性变化方面存在不足。

Method: 1. 使用变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间；2. 在潜在空间上训练潜在扩散模型进行多样化采样；3. 引入关节感知高斯解码器，考虑关节状态依赖的可见性变化来重建逼真外观。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种各向异性池化策略来改进基于查找表（LUT）的CNN图像恢复方法，通过广义中值池化和学习数据依赖的池化系数，替代传统的平均池化，从而更好地处理各向异性信号结构。


<details>

Motivation: 当前基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化来融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合处理各向异性信号结构，限制了性能提升。

Method: 1. 引入广义中值池化方法；2. 扩展为学习数据依赖的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试上的实验结果表明，所提出的各向异性池化策略在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能够有效提升基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法的性能，特别是在处理各向异性信号结构时表现更优。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Conclusion: OpenHype通过双曲几何成功解决了3D场景层次结构建模的挑战，提供了一种更高效和适应性更强的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注离线视频异常检测，而在线检测由于实时性约束和计算强度很少受到关注，需要解决在线VAD的固有复杂性。

Method: 使用流式输入到视觉语言模型，结合LSTM启发的预测机制来建模过去状态，设计评分队列和异常先验来动态存储最近分数并覆盖监控场景中的所有异常。

Conclusion: MoniTor为在线视频异常检测提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，能够有效捕获时间依赖关系并区分正常与异常行为。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Motivation: 现有视频修复方法依赖图像到视频先验，但在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，且缺乏对视频后半部分的控制，导致时空稳定性不足。

Method: 将视频修复解耦为两个子任务，设计CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播策略，通过拼接机制将初始帧内容扩散到后续参考帧，并引入上下文控制器模块约束生成过程中的内容失真。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

*Yiming Tang,Wenjia Zhong,Rushi Shah,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC是一个用于胸部X光诊断的可解释AI框架，通过任务对齐的模式发现从医学图像中提取可解释的视觉模式，在保持高诊断准确性的同时提供透明、可验证的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中取得了显著准确性，但由于其黑盒性质，临床采用受到限制。临床医生需要透明、可验证的解释来信任自动化诊断并识别潜在故障模式。

Method: 训练基于transcoder的稀疏自编码器在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上，将医学图像表示分解为可解释的视觉模式。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上训练100个transcoder的集成模型，发现约5,000个单语义模式。

Result: 发现了涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影类别的约5,000个单语义模式。每个模式在共享特定放射学特征的图像中表现出一致的激活行为，预测可分解为20-50个可解释模式。在五个关键发现上实现了有竞争力的诊断准确性。

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC证明了医学AI系统可以同时实现准确性和可解释性，通过透明、临床基础的解释支持更安全的临床部署。关键创新在于从针对特定诊断目标训练的分类器中提取可解释特征，确保发现的模式与临床决策直接相关。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

TL;DR: 提出双流架构整合组织宏观特征与细胞级特征，通过循环变换器高效聚合细胞信息，并引入双向组织-细胞交互模块，在四个病理亚型分类基准测试中表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病理学基础模型虽能捕捉全局组织上下文，但缺乏细胞级特征建模，限制了在癌症亚型分类等细粒度任务中的表现。

Method: 采用双流架构分别建模宏观组织特征和聚合细胞表示；提出接受度加权的键值聚合模型（循环变换器）以线性复杂度捕获细胞间依赖关系；引入双向组织-细胞交互模块实现局部细胞线索与周围组织环境的相互关注。

Result: 在四个组织病理学亚型分类基准测试中，所提方法优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉编码器主要关注全局图像表示，但忽视了细粒度区域分析，由于缺乏细粒度标注数据和预训练范式，限制了细粒度感知能力。

Method: 构建Gran-29M数据集（包含200万图像和1.8亿区域级标注），采用预训练-适应框架和自蒸馏机制，通过边界框到标题回归和标题到边界框回归增强局部视觉表示和定位能力。

Result: GranViT超越现有视觉编码器，在不同LLMs上表现出强迁移性，在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解任务上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: GranViT通过大规模细粒度预训练和区域级自回归训练，成功提升了视觉编码器的细粒度感知能力，在多模态任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一视角，将条件引导重新表述为不动点迭代，并引入了前瞻引导（FSG）方法，该方法在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题，以提高图像质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并改进无分类器引导（CFG）的操作机制是文本到图像扩散模型研究的核心焦点。现有方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择。

Method: 提出统一视角，将条件引导重新表述为不动点迭代，寻找黄金路径使潜在变量在条件和非条件生成下产生一致输出。引入前瞻引导（FSG），在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题并增加迭代次数。

Result: 在多种数据集和模型架构上的广泛实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 本研究为条件引导提供了新的视角，并释放了自适应设计的潜力。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言和视觉语言模型在广泛任务中表现出色，但其内部机制仍不完全清楚，需要研究注意力头如何专门化处理特定语义或视觉属性。

Method: 基于现有可解释性方法，通过信号处理视角重新解释使用最终解码层探测中间激活的实践，以原则性方式分析多个样本并基于与目标概念的相关性对注意力头进行排序。

Result: 在单模态和多模态Transformer中都发现了头部级别的专业化一致模式，通过编辑仅1%的头部就能可靠地抑制或增强目标概念，在问答、毒性缓解、图像分类和字幕生成等任务中得到验证。

Conclusion: 注意力层内存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley方法，通过冻结预训练的单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的小型跨注意力桥接来实现视频到音频的同步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要端到端重新训练多模态系统，计算成本高且缺乏模块化。Foley Control旨在在保持预训练模型性能的同时，实现高效的多模态同步。

Method: 将V-JEPA2视频嵌入连接到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在现有文本跨注意力后插入紧凑的视频跨注意力层，通过视频令牌池化减少内存需求。

Result: 在视频音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现竞争力，训练参数远少于现有多模态系统，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和模块化。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、模块化的视频到Foley生成方案，其桥接设计可扩展到其他音频模态如语音生成。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GRPO方法在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中存在两个关键限制：不准确的优势归因和忽略生成的时间动态。作者认为将优化范式从步骤级别转移到分块级别可以有效缓解这些问题。

Method: 提出Chunk-GRPO方法，将连续步骤分组为捕捉流匹配内在时间动态的连贯'分块'，并在分块级别优化策略。还引入了可选的加权采样策略来进一步提升性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面都取得了优越的结果。

Conclusion: 分块级别优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景，Chunk-GRPO在文本到图像生成中表现出色。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专门为夜间无人机跟踪设计的多尺度自适应系统，通过三个核心模块解决夜间跟踪的主要技术挑战，在UAVDark135基准测试中性能显著优于现有方法，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪在真实机器人操作中面临重大挑战，包括低光照条件限制视觉感知能力、杂乱背景和频繁视角变化导致跟踪器漂移或失败。现有基于低光增强和域自适应的方法在实际无人机系统中存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和难以充分利用动态物体信息等问题。

Method: MATrack通过三个核心模块协同工作：多尺度层次混合（MHB）增强静态和动态模板之间的特征一致性；自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的物体信息；夜间模板校准器（NTC）确保长序列中的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，MATrack的精度、归一化精度和AUC分别比最先进方法提高了5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。在实际无人机平台上的进一步测试验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为夜间搜索救援和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持，证明了其在真实世界机器人操作中的实用价值。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量和文本可读性之间存在根本性权衡。

Method: TIGER采用两阶段框架，明确将字形恢复与图像增强解耦：首先重建精确的文本结构，然后使用它们指导后续的全图像超分辨率。

Result: 在UltraZoom-ST数据集上的广泛实验表明，TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时提高了可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过字形到图像的引导机制，确保了高保真度和视觉一致性，打破了图像质量与文本可读性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving

Motivation: 显著目标检测面临数据受限问题，昂贵的像素级标注导致相关子任务需要单独训练模型，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道创建包含139,000多张高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，通过扩散和DINO-v3特征提取标签，采用迭代生成框架优先处理具有挑战性的类别，并提出流线型多掩码解码器处理显著目标检测中的固有模糊性。

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据生成和模糊感知架构能够显著提升显著目标检测的泛化能力，为数据受限任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了Modest-Align轻量级跨模态对齐框架，通过随机扰动和嵌入平滑两种策略解决资源受限场景下模型过度自信和性能下降的问题，在少量训练数据和计算资源下实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限场景中，大规模预训练模型（如CLIP）由于数据质量差或相关性弱导致的过度自信和性能下降问题。

Method: 采用随机扰动引入可控噪声模拟不确定性，结合嵌入平滑校准嵌入空间中的相似度分布，共同降低过度自信并提升噪声或弱对齐样本的性能。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的检索任务中优于现有方法，仅使用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间就能达到竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x

for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

*Orest Kupyn,Fabian Manhardt,Federico Tombari,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对极几何约束的视频生成方法，通过偏好优化对齐扩散模型，解决现有视频生成模型中的几何不一致、不稳定运动和视觉伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大潜在扩散变换器的视频生成模型虽然在技术上取得了巨大进步，但仍然存在几何不一致、不稳定运动和视觉伪影等问题，这些问题破坏了真实3D场景的幻觉。3D一致性的视频生成对生成和重建任务的下游应用具有重要影响。

Method: 使用对极几何约束通过偏好优化对齐扩散模型，直接解决不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影问题。该方法通过数学原理的几何强制，高效地实施几何原则，无需端到端的可微性。在静态场景和动态相机上进行训练以确保高质量的测量，同时模型能有效泛化到不同的动态内容。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习度量提供更稳定的优化信号，后者会产生噪声目标从而影响对齐质量。该方法在保持视觉质量的同时生成了空间一致的视频。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用的方法，用于生成空间一致的视频，而不会损害视觉质量。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAP-MAE是一种域自适应点云掩码自编码器预训练方法，通过异构域适配器和域特征生成器，自适应整合跨域数据集知识，解决点云数据稀缺问题，在单一预训练下在多个点云分析任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云数据在不同领域的训练数据规模有限，研究人员尝试结合不同领域数据进行MAE预训练以解决数据稀缺问题，但混合领域学到的先验知识与下游3D点云分析任务可能不匹配，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出DAP-MAE方法，设计异构域适配器在预训练阶段使用适应模式全面学习不同领域点云信息，在微调阶段使用融合模式增强点云特征；同时引入域特征生成器指导点云特征适应各种下游任务。

Result: 仅需一次预训练，DAP-MAE在四个不同点云分析任务中表现优异：在ScanObjectNN上物体分类达到95.18%，在Bosphorus上人脸表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE通过域自适应方法有效解决了跨域点云数据预训练中的知识对齐问题，在多个下游任务中实现了卓越性能。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Gompertz-CNN动态知识蒸馏框架，通过Gompertz增长模型调整蒸馏损失权重，结合Wasserstein距离和梯度匹配，在CIFAR数据集上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法无法捕捉学生模型认知能力的动态演变过程，导致知识转移效果不佳。

Method: 使用Gompertz曲线动态调整蒸馏损失权重，结合Wasserstein距离度量特征差异和梯度匹配对齐反向传播行为，构建多损失目标函数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，相比传统蒸馏方法分别获得最高8%和4%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN框架通过动态调整知识蒸馏过程，有效提升了学生模型的学习效率和性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏可穿戴IMU和UWB距离测量的多人全身运动跟踪方法，通过融合惯性观测和传感器间距离信息来精确估计3D姿态和全局轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纯IMU方法在全局平移估计和多人相对定位方面的局限性，IMU数据缺乏空间参考信息，无法准确跟踪多人之间的相对位置。

Method: 使用超宽带测距(UWB)估计传感器间的绝对距离，将距离信息与惯性观测融合到结构化状态空间模型中，采用新颖的两步优化方法利用估计距离来精确跟踪全局轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据上的评估显示，该方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有最先进方法，创建了首个IMU+UWB双人跟踪数据集GIP-DB。

Conclusion: 展示了IMU+UWB组合在野外多人运动捕捉中的潜力，为多人交互场景提供了有效的运动跟踪解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了长尾识别方法在NACTI野生动物数据集上的应用，通过实验优化LTR损失函数和正则化方法，在NACTI测试集上达到99.40%的Top-1准确率，相比标准交叉熵的95.51%基线有显著提升，并在域迁移测试中表现出更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NACTI野生动物数据集存在严重的类别不平衡问题，最大的'Head'类别占数据集的50%以上。为了解决这种长尾分布对物种识别性能的影响，需要系统研究长尾识别方法。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究各种LTR损失函数和LTR敏感正则化方法，构建Reduced-Bias测试集评估域迁移性能。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40% Top-1准确率，相比95.51%基线有显著提升；在域迁移测试中达到52.55%准确率，优于WCE损失的51.20%。

Conclusion: LTR增强的调度器选择与先进LTR损失函数结合在野生动物领域表现一致改进，但LTR方法仍无法充分解决严重域迁移下'Tail'类别的灾难性性能下降问题。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于邻近突触相似性的无监督方法，用于在EM图像中对突触进行分类，无需预先知道突触类型数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要监督学习，而该方法仅利用同一神经元中邻近突触比随机选择的突触更相似的观察，无需先验知识即可分类突触。

Method: 基于邻近突触相似性的无监督分类方法，应用于果蝇数据。

Result: 成功分离突触为不同类别，无需预先指定类型数量。

Conclusion: 该方法为选择覆盖突触结构范围的ground-truth提供了原则性途径，具有无需预先知道类型数量的优势。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了UNI和Virchow2两种基础模型作为特征提取器在皮肤病理学全玻片图像分类中的性能，发现Virchow2在大多数分类器中表现优于UNI，逻辑回归达到90%的最高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类，以提升诊断效率和准确性。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取补丁级嵌入，通过均值聚合策略聚合成玻片级特征，然后训练多种机器学习分类器（逻辑回归、梯度提升树、随机森林）。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中表现优于UNI，逻辑回归模型达到90%的最高准确率，但差异无统计学显著性。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化全玻片图像分类中具有巨大潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法，并为玻片级表示学习的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

TL;DR: WorldGrow是一个分层框架，用于生成无限扩展的3D场景，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验，实现几何一致且外观逼真的大规模连续环境生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临关键挑战：2D提升方法存在视图间几何和外观不一致问题，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型主要面向对象而非场景级生成。

Method: 提出三个核心组件：1）数据筛选流程提取高质量场景块用于训练；2）3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；3）从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到最先进性能，同时独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: WorldGrow展示了构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，并具有构建未来世界模型的潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖参考图像或大量训练，且往往只解决角色一致性而将背景一致性留给图像到视频模型，难以实现多视频中角色和背景的完全一致性。

Method: 基于对DiT注意力机制和中间特征的系统分析，发现其在去噪过程中能够提取前景掩码和识别匹配点。首先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些缓存变量注入到新生成视频的对应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明，BachVid在生成的视频中实现了稳健的一致性，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖高效的解决方案，可在不依赖参考图像或额外训练的情况下实现一致视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型作为几何求解器的潜力，解决传统上难以处理的几何问题，建立生成建模与几何问题求解之间的桥梁。

Method: 将几何问题实例视为图像，使用标准视觉扩散模型将高斯噪声转换为表示有效近似解的图像，模型学习将噪声几何结构转换为正确配置。

Conclusion: 在图像空间中操作为解决复杂几何问题提供了通用实用框架，为处理更广泛挑战性几何任务打开了大门。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法通过结合CodeAct框架和少量样本的上下文学习，使标准指令微调语言模型在不进行额外微调的情况下达到或超越专门训练推理模型的性能，同时显著提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型虽然成功，但需要大量计算资源和数据来训练，运行速度慢且成本高。研究旨在探索标准指令微调语言模型是否能够在不进行额外训练的情况下实现强大的推理能力。

Method: 提出CodeAdapt方法，结合CodeAct框架（语言模型在自然语言推理中穿插代码执行）和少量样本的上下文学习，仅需5个训练问题即可实现有效推理。

Result: 在四个匹配的语言模型和推理模型对中，CodeAdapt使三个语言模型在八个任务上平均表现优于相应推理模型（最高提升22.9%），同时token效率提高10-81%；在四个模型平均下，六个任务表现更优（最高提升35.7%）。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt式学习和推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，代码增强的语言模型是认知基础扎实且强大的系统，可能为权重内强化学习提供坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 现有长上下文基准大多依赖简化的合成任务，无法代表真实世界文档理解的复杂性，需要开发能捕捉现实高风险任务的基准。

Method: 使用236对案例数据集，评估最先进的大语言模型从美国最高法院案例中识别推翻关系的能力。

Result: 模型在历史案例上表现较差，显示训练中存在时间偏见；依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解；在复杂开放任务中产生时间上不可能的关系。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个解决现实长上下文评估关键差距的基准，为实际法律推理任务的复杂性和风险提供了镜像环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic

*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了置信度门控的思维链技术，通过训练无关的置信度估计方法来判断何时需要启用思维链推理，以减少不必要的token使用并提升模型实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链提示虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但会显著增加token使用量，且在某些任务中可能无益甚至有害。因此需要一种智能机制来决定何时使用思维链。

Method: 提出了置信度门控思维链方法，使用四种训练无关的置信度估计方法来评估模型直接回答的置信度，仅在置信度低时启用思维链推理。

Result: 实验表明现有训练无关置信度方法能有效减少冗余思维链使用，优于随机启用思维链，但不同置信度方法的效果因数据集和模型而异，存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 当前置信度门控思维链方法具有潜力但存在局限性，需要进一步研究更可靠的自适应门控机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统分析了在低假阳性率要求下的推理增强分类任务，发现推理虽然提升整体准确率，但在严格精度要求下表现不佳，而简单集成方法可以结合两种模式的优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索推理增强方法在精度敏感任务中的适用性，特别是在需要严格控制假阳性率的实际应用中，目前尚不清楚推理是否适合这类任务。

Method: 研究在两个任务（安全检测和幻觉检测）上评估了微调和零样本设置，使用标准大语言模型和大推理模型，比较了推理开启和推理关闭两种模式，以及基于token的评分与自述置信度方法。

Result: 结果显示推理开启模式虽然提高整体准确率，但在低假阳性率阈值下表现不佳；推理关闭模式在精度敏感场景中占优；基于token的评分明显优于自述置信度；简单集成方法能够恢复两种模式各自的优势。

Conclusion: 推理是一把双刃剑：对平均准确率有益，但对于需要严格精度的应用往往不合适，建议在精度敏感部署中谨慎使用推理增强方法。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级框架，通过动态选择支持性演示来改进上下文知识编辑，解决了现有方法中的数量-质量权衡和任务难度适应性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在事实回忆方面表现出色，但仍会传播过时或不正确的知识。现有的上下文知识编辑方法依赖静态演示集，存在数量-质量权衡和缺乏任务难度适应性的问题。

Method: 提出DR-IKE框架：(1) 使用REINFORCE训练BERT检索器，根据编辑奖励对演示进行排序；(2) 采用可学习阈值修剪低价值示例，在编辑容易时缩短提示，在任务困难时扩展提示。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准测试中，编辑成功率提高达17.1%，延迟减少41.6%，并在不相关查询上保持准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE展示了可扩展和自适应的知识编辑能力，无需修改模型权重，仅依赖前向传播，与黑盒LLMs兼容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前最先进的问答系统主要针对英语，为解决印尼语等低资源语言的问题，研究旨在通过自适应RAG系统弥合语言差距。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，集成问题复杂度分类器来决定回答策略；使用机器翻译作为数据增强方法来解决印尼语数据集有限的问题。

Result: 实验显示问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了低资源语言问答的潜力和挑战，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

Motivation: 智能药物推荐系统对提高临床决策质量和效率至关重要，但此类系统的发展受到公开可用的真实世界电子健康记录数据集稀缺的严重阻碍，特别是在非英语语言中。

Method: 构建了包含5,894条去标识化记录的CDrugRed数据集，涵盖患者人口统计信息、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等全面信息，并基于该数据集对多种最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，虽然监督微调提高了模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务具有复杂性，CDrugRed作为一个具有挑战性和价值的资源，可用于开发更稳健和准确的药物推荐系统，数据集已公开提供给研究社区。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型对数策略比率的奖励函数，实现无需人工偏好标注的在线策略微调，解决了SFT在有限数据场景下的过拟合和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)作为对齐大语言模型的重要方法，在有限数据场景下存在过拟合和域外泛化能力差的问题，需要改进以提升数据效率和泛化性能。

Method: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，将SFT与近端策略优化(PPO)结合，核心是设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型对数策略比率的奖励函数，该函数作为隐式奖励信号，以预训练策略为基线、SFT策略为目标，实现无需人工偏好的在线策略微调。

Result: 在多个自然语言处理任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的情况下，能够有效提升泛化能力、数据效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding PPO通过结合SFT和PPO的优势，利用自奖励机制有效解决了SFT的局限性，为使用演示数据对齐大语言模型提供了更有效的方法，尤其在数据稀缺场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

TL;DR: 提出VeriGray基准，通过引入Out-Dependent类别解决摘要忠实性评估中的标注模糊问题，发现即使是SOTA LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM摘要忠实性基准存在标注模糊问题，主要是由于生成输出中允许的外部知识边界不明确，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出新的忠实性标注框架，引入中间类别Out-Dependent来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建VeriGray基准。

Result: 统计显示SOTA LLM在摘要任务中存在约6%的幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准对多种基线方法构成挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊性对于不忠实性检测基准至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语义理解方面表现出色但缺乏结构化推理能力，而文本属性图提供显式关系结构但语义深度不足，两者的结合可以产生互补优势。

Method: 提出了基于编排视角的分类法，将LLM-TAG集成分为两个基本方向：LLM for TAG和TAG for LLM，并细分为顺序、并行和多模块三种编排策略。

Result: 总结了实证见解，整理了可用数据集，展示了在推荐系统、生物医学分析和知识密集型问答等领域的多样化应用。

Conclusion: LLM与TAG的集成在语言和图学习的交叉领域具有广阔前景，但仍面临开放挑战，需要进一步研究来指导未来发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出一个系统框架分析LLM在社会模拟中的行为，发现LLM不能忠实复制真实人类行为，而是反映过度理想化的版本，表现出社会角色偏见、首因效应和积极性偏见，形成缺乏真实人类互动复杂性的'乌托邦'社会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的人类行为模拟对于解释、预测和干预社会至关重要。虽然LLM在模拟人类行为、互动和决策方面显示出潜力，但LLM在社会情境中与真实人类行为的差异程度仍未充分探索，存在科学研究和实际应用中误解的风险。

Method: 引入一个系统框架分析LLM在社会模拟中的行为，通过聊天室式对话模拟多智能体互动，并在五个语言维度上进行分析，提供简单有效的方法来检验新兴的社会认知偏见。

Result: 对三个家族中的八个代表性LLM进行广泛实验，发现LLM不能忠实复制真实人类行为，而是反映过度理想化的版本，受到社会期望偏见的影响。LLM表现出社会角色偏见、首因效应和积极性偏见，形成缺乏真实人类互动复杂性和变异性的'乌托邦'社会。

Conclusion: 这些发现呼吁需要更多社会基础化的LLM，以捕捉人类社会行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse
surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在自然语言生成方面取得了显著进展，但仍表现出重复和不连贯等令人困惑的行为，即使困惑度很低。这凸显了传统评估指标的局限性，这些指标强调局部预测准确性而忽略了长距离结构复杂性。

Method: 引入相关维度作为分形几何度量，用于量化语言模型感知的文本自我相似性。该方法捕捉语言的分层递归结构，在统一框架中桥接局部和全局属性。

Result: 实验表明相关维度能够：(1) 揭示预训练中的三个不同阶段；(2) 反映上下文依赖的复杂性；(3) 指示模型的幻觉倾向；(4) 可靠检测生成文本中的多种退化形式。该方法计算效率高，对模型量化（低至4位精度）具有鲁棒性，适用于各种自回归架构。

Conclusion: 相关维度为理解大型语言模型的生成动态提供了新的视角，能够有效评估文本的结构复杂性，弥补传统评估指标的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PBS-Attn的置换块稀疏注意力方法，通过利用注意力的置换特性来提高块级稀疏性，从而在保持模型精度的同时显著提升长上下文预填充的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型扩展上下文长度具有显著优势但计算成本高昂，主要瓶颈在于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。虽然注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，但现有块稀疏注意力方法在块级稀疏性方面存在优化空间。

Method: 提出PBS-Attn方法，通过置换序列块来增加块级稀疏性，减少计算冗余，并开发了自定义的置换-FlashAttention内核来实现端到端加速。

Result: 在真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型精度上持续优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，并接近全注意力基线，在长上下文预填充中实现了最高2.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种即插即用的高效注意力方法，通过提高块级稀疏性显著提升了长上下文处理的计算效率，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

### [78] [Efficient semantic uncertainty quantification in language models via diversity-steered sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21310)
*Ji Won Park,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性导向的采样器，通过注入语义相似性惩罚来减少冗余输出，提高不确定性估计的样本效率，无需访问基础LLM的梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中准确估计LLM的语义偶然性和认知不确定性具有挑战性，因为通常需要大量昂贵的生成来获得稳定估计。

Method: 使用自然语言推理模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，结合重要性重加权和方差缩减技术来去偏和优化不确定性估计。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法在相同样本数量下匹配或超越基线方法，覆盖更多语义簇。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架可作为风险敏感模型部署中不确定性估计的即插即用增强方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

### [79] [Typoglycemia under the Hood: Investigating Language Models' Understanding of Scrambled Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21326)
*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了NLP模型在字符顺序被打乱（typoglycemia）时的鲁棒性，发现英语中较少单词会因此混淆，且混淆词在上下文中易于区分，导致性能下降较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解为什么NLP模型在字符顺序被打乱时仍能表现良好，尽管许多不同单词（如form和from）在这种情况下会变成相同的表示。

Method: 方法包括分析英国国家语料库以量化单词混淆和歧义，评估BERT区分混淆形式的能力，以及通过比较在干净和打乱文本上训练的BERT变体进行探测实验。

Result: 结果显示，字符打乱导致的性能下降比预期小，因为英语中相对较少的单词会混淆，且混淆词在上下文中差异明显，易于区分。

Conclusion: 结论是NLP模型对字符顺序打乱的鲁棒性主要源于英语中单词混淆较少，且混淆词在上下文中的差异使得消歧变得简单。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

### [80] [TripTide: A Benchmark for Adaptive Travel Planning under Disruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21329)
*Priyanshu Karmakar,Soumyabrata Chaudhuri,Shubhojit Mallick,Manish Gupta,Abhik Jana,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide是首个评估LLM在现实旅行中断情况下重新制定行程能力的基准，通过建模中断严重性和旅行者容忍度等关键维度，全面评估LLM对航班取消、天气关闭等事件的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能够生成个性化行程，但无法有效应对现实旅行中常见的各种中断情况，需要评估LLM在动态变化环境中的适应能力。

Method: 采用三重评估方法：1) 引入自动指标（意图保持、响应性、适应性）；2) 应用LLM-as-a-judge方法自动评估修订质量；3) 进行手动专家评估验证语义、空间、序列和响应方面的保持情况。

Result: 实验表明LLM在序列一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，但空间偏差在短途旅行中较大，随着行程延长而减小；随着计划长度增加，中断处理能力下降，显示LLM鲁棒性存在局限。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估基于LLM的旅行规划系统在现实不确定性下的适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了LLM在动态环境中的优势和局限性。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

### [81] [Multi-turn Training with Basic Human Feedback Helps Little on LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21339)
*Qiang Liu,Wuganjing Song,Zhenzhou Lin,Feifan Chen,Qiaolong Cai,Chen Li,Yongduo Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，对于推理任务，单轮训练比多轮训练更有效。单轮训练的模型在单轮和多轮评估中都能良好泛化，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的推理能力通常通过单轮强化学习开发，但实际应用涉及多轮人机交互，存在训练与部署条件不匹配的问题。本研究旨在探究多轮训练是否对推理任务必要。

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮策略，评估模型在不同设置下的表现。

Result: 单轮训练模型在单轮和多轮评估中都能有效泛化，而多轮训练模型在单轮推理性能上出现显著下降。多轮训练仅提供有限收益，甚至可能损害推理能力。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练带来的收益有限且可能降低推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

### [82] [A Diagnostic Benchmark for Sweden-Related Factual Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21360)
*Jenny Kunz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的手动编写问答基准，用于测试模型对瑞典特定知识的掌握程度，发现具有更强瑞典覆盖范围的小模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多瑞典基准测试都是翻译自美国中心的基准测试，不适合测试与瑞典特别相关或特定于瑞典的知识，因此需要创建一个专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的问答基准。

Method: 研究人员手动编写了一个问答基准，从瑞典文化和媒体的公众人物以及主要体育赛事中获取灵感，创建了包含英语翻译的数据集，用于测量不同规模和瑞典覆盖程度的模型的事实回忆能力。

Result: 研究发现，具有更强瑞典覆盖范围的小模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当；继续在瑞典语上进行预训练通常会提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前已知信息的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集有潜力作为诊断工具，用于研究多语言模型中的语言适应和知识保留，以及在语言适应过程中的表现。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

### [83] [SindBERT, the Sailor: Charting the Seas of Turkish NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21364)
*Raphael Scheible-Schmitt,Stefan Schweter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SindBERT是首个基于RoBERTa的大规模土耳其语编码器模型，在多个NLP任务中表现优异，但研究发现模型规模扩大并未带来一致的性能提升，强调了语料质量的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对形态丰富的语言在大型预训练模型中代表性不足的问题，开发首个大规模土耳其语RoBERTa编码器模型，填补土耳其NLP领域的空白。

Method: 使用312GB土耳其语文本（mC4、OSCAR23、Wikipedia）从头训练SindBERT模型，提供基础和大型两种配置，并在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准上进行评估。

Result: SindBERT在土耳其语和多语言模型中表现具有竞争力，大型变体在4个任务中的2个获得最佳分数，但整体未显示出一致的规模优势。与BERTurk等更小但更精选的模型比较表明，语料质量和多样性比数据量更重要。

Conclusion: SindBERT作为土耳其NLP的开放资源，同时提供了关于模型规模限制和语料组成在形态丰富语言中核心作用的实证案例研究。模型以MIT许可证发布，支持fairseq和Huggingface格式。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

*Abderrazek Abid,Thanh-Cong Ho,Fakhri Karray*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中的应用，提出了评估方法和数据集，发现VLMs在准确率方面与传统深度学习模型相当甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，视觉语言模型在医疗健康应用中显示出潜力，但在人类活动识别领域的应用相对未被充分探索，且缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 引入了描述性字幕数据集，并提出了全面的评估方法来评估VLMs在人类活动识别中的表现，与最先进的深度学习模型进行了对比实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，视觉语言模型在准确率方面与传统的深度学习方法表现相当，在某些情况下甚至超越了传统方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为视觉语言模型在智能医疗系统中的集成提供了强有力的基准，并开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

*Giovanni Trappolini,Florin Cuconasu,Simone Filice,Yoelle Maarek,Fabrizio Silvestri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了UDCG指标，针对RAG系统中LLM处理检索文档的特点，改进了传统IR指标，通过考虑文档效用和干扰因素，显著提升了与端到端答案准确性的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类用户顺序浏览文档的假设，不适用于RAG系统中LLM整体处理文档的方式，且未考虑干扰文档对生成质量的负面影响。

Method: 引入基于效用的标注方案，量化相关文档的正面贡献和干扰文档的负面影响，提出UDCG指标，采用LLM导向的位置折扣机制。

Result: 在五个数据集和六个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标相关性提升高达36%。

Conclusion: UDCG为IR评估与LLM消费者的对齐提供了关键步骤，能够更可靠地评估RAG组件性能。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

Motivation: 随着可穿戴设备的普及，远程患者监测需求增加，但现有研究在人机交互方面存在明显不足，因此需要开发一个能够实现更好人机交互的自主远程健康监测系统。

Method: 系统集成多模态大语言模型、物联网和可穿戴设备，自动收集生命体征、加速度计数据和患者视频，通过异常检测模块（包括跌倒检测模型）识别紧急情况，并利用自然语言处理组件检测患者活动和情绪，通过提示工程整合所有患者信息。

Result: 开发了一个完整原型系统，实验证明系统在实际场景中具有可实施性和可扩展性，能够减少医护人员工作负担和医疗成本。

Conclusion: REMONI系统通过整合先进技术实现了有效的远程健康监测，改善了人机交互体验，具有实际应用价值和推广潜力。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多奖励优化方法，通过增强扩散语言模型中的token相关性来提高推理性能，同时实现采样加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在推理性能上仍落后于自回归大语言模型，特别是在去噪步骤减少时。分析发现主要问题在于去噪过程中掩码token的独立生成未能捕捉token相关性。

Method: 提出多奖励优化方法，利用测试时缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习直接优化token相关性，并引入组步和重要性采样策略来减少奖励方差和提高采样效率。

Result: 实验表明MRO不仅提高了推理性能，还在保持推理基准高表现的同时实现了显著的采样加速。

Conclusion: 增强token相关性是提升扩散语言模型推理性能的有效途径，多奖励优化方法能够有效解决这一问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法对脑对齐的估计和改进都是参与者依赖的，且受限于每个参与者的数据量，这阻碍了向新参与者的泛化和群体层面的分析。

Method: 采用多参与者脑调优方法，微调预训练语音语言模型来联合预测多个参与者的fMRI响应。

Result: 1) 预测新参与者脑数据所需的fMRI数据量减少5倍；2) 整体脑对齐提高达50%；3) 对未见数据集具有强泛化能力；4) 下游语义任务性能提升。

Conclusion: 多参与者脑调优方法在神经科学和AI之间建立了双向获益，有助于弥合两个领域之间的差距。

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

Conclusion: 结论表明范畴论框架为多模态文档分析提供了强大的数学基础，能够有效提取文档结构、度量信息、生成摘要，并通过自监督学习改进现有模型性能。

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型是否对语言谱系结构敏感，发现模型在提示语言保真度不足时会倾向于切换到谱系相关语言，且知识一致性在谱系内部优于跨谱系。谱系效应存在但受训练资源可用性强烈影响，不同LLM家族表现出不同的多语言策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言行为上表现出显著差异，但语言谱系结构在这种差异中的作用尚未充分探索。本研究旨在调查LLM是否对语言谱系敏感。

Method: 通过扩展MultiQ数据集上的先前分析，首先检查当提示语言保真度未保持时，模型是否倾向于切换到谱系相关语言；然后调查知识一致性在谱系内部是否优于跨谱系。

Result: 研究发现谱系水平效应存在但受训练资源可用性强烈影响，不同LLM家族表现出不同的多语言策略。

Conclusion: LLM编码了谱系水平结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍然是塑造其多语言性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的提升，需要超越表层语言能力的更具挑战性评估，特别是语用学理解，即理解由上下文以及语言和文化规范塑造的情境意义。

Method: 构建了包含405个多项选择题的斯洛文尼亚语语用理解基准，讨论了翻译的困难，建立了人类基线，并对LLMs进行了试点评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有显著改进，但在推断非字面表达中隐含的说话者意义方面仍可能失败，特别是那些文化特定的表达。专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准必须精心设计，最好从本地数据构建，并用人类响应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

*Kellen Parker van Dam,Abishek Stephen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出无监督异常检测方法，用于识别词表中音位组合的不一致性，应用于Kokborok语言变体与孟加拉语的多语言数据集，旨在发现转录错误和借词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言文档中的词汇数据收集常包含转录错误和未记录的借词，这会误导语言分析。

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音位组合特征，应用无监督异常检测算法识别潜在的转录错误和借词。

Result: 由于这些异常的微妙性质，精确度和召回率保持适中，但音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线。高召回率方法为田野工作者提供了系统化的标记需要验证条目的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法支持低资源语言文档中数据质量的改进，为田野工作者提供了验证词汇条目的工具。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

TL;DR: 本文提出Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning)方法，通过构建分析框架、组织和评分证据来增强大语言模型在股票预测任务中的推理能力，解决现有模型过度依赖分析师观点而缺乏独立分析逻辑的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和编程任务上表现出色，但在股票预测等金融任务中的应用仍未被充分探索。研究发现现有模型过度依赖分析师观点，缺乏系统性的独立分析逻辑，且未能有效权衡对抗性证据。

Method: 提出RETuning方法，在强化学习前进行冷启动训练，鼓励模型动态构建分析框架，基于框架而非上下文观点来组织和评分涨跌证据，最后进行反思得出预测。

Result: 构建了大规模数据集（2024年全年5123只A股，32K上下文长度，20万+样本），实验表明RETuning成功解锁了模型在金融领域的推理能力，即使在6个月后或分布外股票上仍能有效工作。

Conclusion: RETuning方法通过增强模型的独立逻辑推理能力，减少上下文不当影响，使模型获得了有价值的股票预测洞察，在金融领域展现出持续有效的推理能力。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Motivation: 现有从经典逻辑到概率模型的方法只能揭示推理输出或个体建模的某些方面，但缺乏对人类推理动态过程的统一量化描述。

Method: 引入信息流追踪（IF-Track），利用大语言模型作为概率编码器，在多样化任务中进行细粒度分析，量化推理步骤中的信息熵和增益。

Result: IF-Track成功在单一度量空间中建模了人类推理行为的普遍图景，捕捉了基本推理特征，识别了系统性错误模式，并表征了个体差异。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和测量之间建立了量化桥梁，为推理架构提供了机制性洞见，并揭示了人工智能与人类认知的对齐以及大语言模型如何重塑人类推理过程。

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

Motivation: 传统评估方法无法满足基于基础模型的智能体架构评估需求，因为智能体具有复合架构、自主非确定性行为和持续演化等独特特性。

Method: 开发了AgentArcEval评估方法和智能体特定通用场景目录，用于设计和评估智能体架构。

Result: 通过真实世界税务助手Luna的案例研究，验证了AgentArcEval方法和场景目录的实用性。

Conclusion: AgentArcEval方法能够有效解决基于基础模型的智能体架构评估的复杂性，为智能体架构设计和评估提供了专门工具。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models (FMs) has enabled the development of
highly capable and autonomous agents, unlocking new application opportunities
across a wide range of domains. Evaluating the architecture of agents is
particularly important as the architectural decisions significantly impact the
quality attributes of agents given their unique characteristics, including
compound architecture, autonomous and non-deterministic behaviour, and
continuous evolution. However, these traditional methods fall short in
addressing the evaluation needs of agent architecture due to the unique
characteristics of these agents. Therefore, in this paper, we present
AgentArcEval, a novel agent architecture evaluation method designed specially
to address the complexities of FM-based agent architecture and its evaluation.
Moreover, we present a catalogue of agent-specific general scenarios, which
serves as a guide for generating concrete scenarios to design and evaluate the
agent architecture. We demonstrate the usefulness of AgentArcEval and the
catalogue through a case study on the architecture evaluation of a real-world
tax copilot, named Luna.

TL;DR: 提出了BDiff算法，一种能够识别块级和行级编辑操作的文本差异分析工具，解决了现有方法在处理跨多行代码块操作时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码差异分析工具在处理跨多行代码块操作时存在局限性，只能将块级操作表示为离散的行级编辑操作序列，这严重影响了开发人员理解代码变更的效率。

Method: 基于传统差异分析算法，首先构建包含所有可能行映射和块映射的候选集，然后利用Kuhn-Munkres算法计算最优映射集，以最小化编辑脚本大小并贴近开发者原始意图。

Result: 实验结果表明，BDiff在保持竞争性运行时间的同时，比基线工具产生更高质量的差异分析结果，同时揭示了LLM在代码差异分析任务中结果质量不可靠且运行效率不可行的问题。

Conclusion: BDiff能够有效识别块级编辑操作，显著提升代码变更理解的效率，为解决现有差异分析工具的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Code differencing is a fundamental technique in software engineering practice
and research. While researchers have proposed text-based differencing
techniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing
methods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that
operate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in
developers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or
duplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent
such block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling
developers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the
efficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a
text-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of
block-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional
differencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all
possible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres
algorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size
of the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's
intent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five
state-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines
and adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their
performance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental
results show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than
baseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our
experiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks
regarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime
efficiency. We have implemented a web-based visual differencing tool.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: R2ComSync是一个基于检索和重排的代码-注释同步方法，通过集成混合检索和多轮重排策略，利用大语言模型提升代码注释同步的性能和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代码-注释同步方法存在泛化能力不足或需要大量特定任务学习资源的问题，而大语言模型虽然在该领域有潜力，但缺乏有效的上下文学习示例且难以优先选择正确候选项。

Method: R2ComSync采用集成混合检索（同时考虑代码-注释语义和变更模式的相似性）来创建有效的上下文学习提示，并使用多轮重排策略（基于三个重要规则）来优先选择相对正确的候选项。

Result: 在三个涵盖Java和Python编程语言的CCS数据集上评估，R2ComSync在五个最新的大语言模型上表现出优于其他五种最先进方法的性能，且同步的注释质量显著更高。

Conclusion: R2ComSync通过检索和重排增强的上下文学习方法，有效解决了大语言模型在代码-注释同步任务中的局限性，实现了优越的性能和高质量的注释同步。

Abstract: Code-Comment Synchronization (CCS) aims to synchronize the comments with code
changes in an automated fashion, thereby significantly reducing the workload of
developers during software maintenance and evolution. While previous studies
have proposed various solutions that have shown success, they often exhibit
limitations, such as a lack of generalization ability or the need for extensive
task-specific learning resources. This motivates us to investigate the
potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area. However, a pilot
analysis proves that LLMs fall short of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) CCS approaches
because (1) they lack instructive demonstrations for In-Context Learning (ICL)
and (2) many correct-prone candidates are not prioritized.To tackle the above
challenges, we propose R2ComSync, an ICL-based code-Comment Synchronization
approach enhanced with Retrieval and Re-ranking. Specifically, R2ComSync
carries corresponding two novelties: (1) Ensemble hybrid retrieval. It equally
considers the similarity in both code-comment semantics and change patterns
when retrieval, thereby creating ICL prompts with effective examples. (2)
Multi-turn re-ranking strategy. We derived three significant rules through
large-scale CCS sample analysis. Given the inference results of LLMs, it
progressively exploits three re-ranking rules to prioritize relatively
correct-prone candidates. We evaluate R2ComSync using five recent LLMs on three
CCS datasets covering both Java and Python programming languages, and make
comparisons with five SOTA approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of R2ComSync against other approaches. Moreover, both
quantitative and qualitative analyses provide compelling evidence that the
comments synchronized by our proposal exhibit significantly higher quality.}

TL;DR: 本研究比较了大型语言模型(LLMs)和小型语言模型(SLMs)在需求工程分类任务上的表现，发现SLMs虽然比LLMs小300倍，但性能几乎相当，且在某些数据集上召回率更高，是LLMs的可行替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需求工程任务中表现出色，但存在计算成本高、数据共享风险和依赖外部服务等问题。小型语言模型提供了轻量级、本地可部署的替代方案，但其在需求工程任务中的准确性表现尚不明确。

Method: 研究比较了8个模型(3个LLMs和5个SLMs)，在PROMISE、PROMISE Reclass和SecReq数据集上进行需求分类任务评估。

Result: LLMs的平均F1分数比SLMs高2%，但差异无统计学意义。SLMs在所有数据集上几乎达到LLMs的性能，在PROMISE Reclass数据集上甚至召回率更高，尽管模型大小最多小300倍。数据集特征对性能的影响比模型大小更重要。

Conclusion: SLMs是需求分类任务中LLMs的有效替代方案，在隐私保护、成本和本地部署方面具有优势。

Abstract: [Context and motivation] Large language models (LLMs) show notable results in
natural language processing (NLP) tasks for requirements engineering (RE).
However, their use is compromised by high computational cost, data sharing
risks, and dependence on external services. In contrast, small language models
(SLMs) offer a lightweight, locally deployable alternative. [Question/problem]
It remains unclear how well SLMs perform compared to LLMs in RE tasks in terms
of accuracy. [Results] Our preliminary study compares eight models, including
three LLMs and five SLMs, on requirements classification tasks using the
PROMISE, PROMISE Reclass, and SecReq datasets. Our results show that although
LLMs achieve an average F1 score of 2% higher than SLMs, this difference is not
statistically significant. SLMs almost reach LLMs performance across all
datasets and even outperform them in recall on the PROMISE Reclass dataset,
despite being up to 300 times smaller. We also found that dataset
characteristics play a more significant role in performance than model size.
[Contribution] Our study contributes with evidence that SLMs are a valid
alternative to LLMs for requirements classification, offering advantages in
privacy, cost, and local deployability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习框架测试方法无法检测自动驾驶系统中框架特有的质量问题，如内存崩溃和分配错误，因为生成的测试模型缺乏多输入/输出张量处理、多模态数据处理和多级数据特征提取等关键能力。

Method: Scalpel在模型组件级别生成测试输入模型，通过维护和更新模型组件库（包括头、颈、骨干等组件），通过选择、变异和组装这些组件来生成支持自动驾驶系统所需能力的模型。

Result: 成功生成的模型被添加回组件库以丰富资源库，新生成的模型在自动驾驶系统中部署，通过差分测试来测试汽车深度学习框架。

Conclusion: Scalpel方法能够有效解决自动驾驶深度学习框架测试中的关键挑战，生成具备必要能力的测试模型来检测框架质量问题。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) plays a key role in autonomous driving systems. DL models
support perception modules, equipped with tasks such as object detection and
sensor fusion. These DL models enable vehicles to process multi-sensor inputs
to understand complex surroundings. Deploying DL models in autonomous driving
systems faces stringent challenges, including real-time processing, limited
computational resources, and strict power constraints. To address these
challenges, automotive DL frameworks (e.g., PaddleInference) have emerged to
optimize inference efficiency. However, these frameworks encounter unique
quality issues due to their more complex deployment environments, such as
crashes stemming from limited scheduled memory and incorrect memory allocation.
Unfortunately, existing DL framework testing methods fail to detect these
quality issues due to the failure in deploying generated test input models, as
these models lack three essential capabilities: (1) multi-input/output tensor
processing, (2) multi-modal data processing, and (3) multi-level data feature
extraction. These capabilities necessitate specialized model components, which
existing testing methods neglect during model generation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Scalpel, an automotive DL frameworks testing method that generates
test input models at the model component level. Scalpel generates models by
assembling model components (heads, necks, backbones) to support capabilities
required by autonomous driving systems. Specifically, Scalpel maintains and
updates a repository of model components, generating test inputs by selecting,
mutating, and assembling them. Successfully generated models are added back to
enrich the repository. Newly generated models are then deployed within the
autonomous driving system to test automotive DL frameworks via differential
testing.

Motivation: 软件供应链攻击日益增多，但由于其复杂性，全面漏洞分析具有挑战性。现有工作主要关注技术层面的依赖监控和组件控制，缺乏通过理解社会技术动态来指导威胁检测的方法。

Method: 提出开发和研究使用社会技术模型来支持软件供应链的自适应威胁检测。通过分析XZ Utils攻击案例，展示恶意行为者如何通过GitHub和邮件列表破坏维护者信任。

Result: 研究表明，监控技术和社会数据可以识别指示可疑行为的趋势，从而为有针对性和深入的漏洞评估提供信息。

Conclusion: 确定了实现这一愿景的挑战和研究方向，包括开发者和软件分析技术、去中心化适应以及软件供应链安全研究测试平台的需求。

Abstract: Software supply chains (SSCs) are complex systems composed of dynamic,
heterogeneous technical and social components which collectively achieve the
production and maintenance of software artefacts. Attacks on SSCs are
increasing, yet pervasive vulnerability analysis is challenging due to their
complexity. Therefore, threat detection must be targeted, to account for the
large and dynamic structure, and adaptive, to account for its change and
diversity. While current work focuses on technical approaches for monitoring
supply chain dependencies and establishing component controls, approaches which
inform threat detection through understanding the socio-technical dynamics are
lacking. We outline a position and research vision to develop and investigate
the use of socio-technical models to support adaptive threat detection of SSCs.
We motivate this approach through an analysis of the XZ Utils attack whereby
malicious actors undermined the maintainers' trust via the project's GitHub and
mailing lists. We highlight that monitoring technical and social data can
identify trends which indicate suspicious behaviour to then inform targeted and
intensive vulnerability assessment. We identify challenges and research
directions to achieve this vision considering techniques for developer and
software analysis, decentralised adaptation and the need for a test bed for
software supply chain security research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试存在多种失效模式，可能影响基准测试的偏差、方差、覆盖范围和人们对基准证据的理解能力，需要系统化的风险评估方法。

Method: 基于NIST风险管理流程，迭代分析26个流行基准测试，识别潜在失效模式和缓解策略，开发BenchRisk评分系统评估基准测试风险。

Result: 所有26个基准测试在五个维度（全面性、可理解性、一致性、正确性、持久性）中的一个或多个维度存在显著风险，BenchRisk能够有效比较不同基准测试的风险水平。

Conclusion: LLM基准测试领域存在重要的开放研究方向，BenchRisk作为开源工具有助于识别和共享风险及其缓解措施，提高基准测试的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) benchmarks inform LLM use decisions (e.g., "is
this LLM safe to deploy for my use case and context?"). However, benchmarks may
be rendered unreliable by various failure modes that impact benchmark bias,
variance, coverage, or people's capacity to understand benchmark evidence.
Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's risk management
process as a foundation, this research iteratively analyzed 26 popular
benchmarks, identifying 57 potential failure modes and 196 corresponding
mitigation strategies. The mitigations reduce failure likelihood and/or
severity, providing a frame for evaluating "benchmark risk," which is scored to
provide a metaevaluation benchmark: BenchRisk. Higher scores indicate that
benchmark users are less likely to reach an incorrect or unsupported conclusion
about an LLM. All 26 scored benchmarks present significant risk within one or
more of the five scored dimensions (comprehensiveness, intelligibility,
consistency, correctness, and longevity), which points to important open
research directions for the field of LLM benchmarking. The BenchRisk workflow
allows for comparison between benchmarks; as an open-source tool, it also
facilitates the identification and sharing of risks and their mitigations.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在软件工程任务中，多个LLM模型具有显著的互补性，理论性能上限比最佳单模型高83%。基于共识的策略会陷入"流行度陷阱"，而基于多样性的策略能实现95%的理论潜力，即使是小型双模型集成也能有效提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前追求单一大型语言模型处理所有软件工程任务既资源密集又忽视了模型互补性的潜在优势。然而，模型间的互补程度和最大化集成潜力的最佳策略尚不明确，使得从业者缺乏超越单模型系统的明确路径。

Method: 实证比较了来自5个家族的10个LLM模型及其3种集成方式，在代码生成和程序修复等3个软件工程基准测试中进行评估。评估了模型间的互补性、最佳单模型与集成之间的性能差距，并评估了从集成候选中识别正确解决方案的各种选择启发式方法。

Result: 发现集成模型的理论性能上限比最佳单模型高83%。基于共识的策略会放大常见但不正确的输出，而基于多样性的策略能实现95%的理论潜力，即使在小型双模型集成中也有效。

Conclusion: 通过利用多个LLM的互补性，基于多样性的策略提供了一种成本效益高的方式来显著提升软件工程任务的性能，即使是小型模型集成也能带来实质性改进。

Abstract: Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software
engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of
complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However,
the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for
maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a
clear path to move beyond single-model systems.
  To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five
families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering
benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the
complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best
individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection
heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool.
  We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be
83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based
strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying
common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes
up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small
two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by
leveraging multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: 该自动化地面段概念为卫星通信任务提供了高效、可靠的运营解决方案，特别在无人值守情况下仍能保证任务执行的连续性和灵活性，为未来类似任务提供了可借鉴的技术框架。

Abstract: We present our approach for a periodically unstaffed, fully automated ground
segment. The concept is in use for the first time on the German satellite
communications mission Heinrich Hertz on behalf of the German Space Agency at
DLR. Heinrich Hertz was launched in July 2023 and offers access to scientific
and technical experiments to its users. The mission utilizes major automation
concepts for the satellite platform operations, allowing fully automated
operations outside of office hours. The concept includes tracking, telemetry
and commanding (TTC) of the satellite. Pre-planned and automatically executed
schedules enable commanding without human interaction. The user mission
schedule is planned separately from the main mission schedule and is
automatically de-conflicted. The automatic monitoring concept monitors the
systems of the satellite and all assets in the ground segment and triggers
reactions in operator-configurable ways depending on the mission needs, for
example emergency notifications or automated execution of flight operation
procedures. Additionally, the concept also puts special emphasis on a
self-service user portal that provides flexible access 24/7, even when the
control center is not staffed. The portal allows external users of the payload
to schedule pre-defined experiments, monitor the live execution of the
experiment with browser-based displays and access ground station telemetry and
dedicated RF test equipment during the time of their scheduled experiment.
Tasks can be planned long in advance as well as with a short reaction time
(less than 1 minute), which allows, for example, the reconfiguration of the
payload during a running experiment.

Conclusion: GDPR需求需要在工程生命周期的不同抽象层次上处理以实现隐私设计，法律知识应被捕获在规范中以满足不同利益相关者的需求并确保合规性。

Abstract: Context: Consistent requirements and system specifications are essential for
the compliance of software systems towards the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Both artefacts need to be grounded in the original text and
conjointly assure the achievement of privacy by design (PbD). Objectives: There
is little understanding of the perspectives of practitioners on specification
objectives and goals to address PbD. Existing approaches do not account for the
complex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In
this study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system
specification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:
We reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with
practitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the
underlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We
developed and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification
for PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The
relationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is
instrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the
modeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to
specification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification
transparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed
throughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to
achieve PbD. Legal knowledge specified in the GDPR text should be captured in
specifications to address the demands of different stakeholders and ensure
compliance. While our results confirm the suitability of our approach to
address practical needs, we also revealed specific needs for the future
effective operationalization of the approach.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently proliferated in both size and
complexity. Using multi-source and heterogeneous IoT data aids in providing
efficient data analytics for a variety of prevalent and crucial applications.
To address the privacy and security concerns raised by analyzing IoT data
locally or in the cloud, distributed data analytics techniques were proposed to
collect and analyze data in edge or fog devices. In this context, federated
learning has been recommended as an ideal distributed machine/deep
learning-based technique for edge/fog computing environments. Additionally, the
data analytics results are time-sensitive; they should be generated with
minimal latency and high reliability. As a result, reusing efficient
architectures validated through a high number of challenging test cases would
be advantageous. The work proposed here presents a solution using a
microservices-based architecture that allows an IoT application to be
structured as a collection of fine-grained, loosely coupled, and reusable
entities. The proposed solution uses the promising capabilities of federated
learning to provide intelligent microservices that ensure efficient, flexible,
and extensible data analytics. This solution aims to deliver cloud calculations
to the edge to reduce latency and bandwidth congestion while protecting the
privacy of exchanged data. The proposed approach was validated through an
IoT-malware detection and classification use case. MaleVis, a publicly
available dataset, was used in the experiments to analyze and validate the
proposed approach. This dataset included more than 14,000 RGB-converted images,
comprising 25 malware classes and one benign class. The results showed that our
proposed approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection and classification performance, with a 99.24%.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出FPT-Noise方法，通过动态特征调制器和特征感知阈值来增强CLIP模型的对抗鲁棒性，无需昂贵的微调过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但极易受到对抗攻击，传统对抗训练方法计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用动态特征调制器生成图像特定和攻击自适应的噪声强度参数，建立特征感知阈值区分干净图像和对抗图像，结合场景感知调节和测试时变换集成。

Result: 在AutoAttack下将平均鲁棒准确率从0.07%提升至56.86%，同时在干净图像上性能仅下降1.1%。

Conclusion: FPT-Noise显著优于现有测试时防御方法，为增强视觉语言模型对抗鲁棒性提供了有效且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have revealed that VLMs, including CLIP, are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, particularly on their visual modality. Traditional methods
for improving adversarial robustness, such as adversarial training, involve
extensive retraining and can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we
propose a new Test-Time defense: Feature Perception Threshold Counterattack
Noise (FPT-Noise), which enhances the adversarial robustness of CLIP without
costly fine-tuning. Our core contributions are threefold: First, we introduce a
Dynamic Feature Modulator that dynamically generate an image-specific and
attack-adaptive noise intensity parameter. Second, We reanalyzed the image
features of CLIP. When images are exposed to different levels of noise, clean
images and adversarial images exhibit distinct rates of feature change. We
established a feature perception threshold to distinguish clean images from
attacked ones. Finally, we integrate a Scene-Aware Regulation guided by a
stability threshold and leverage Test-Time Transformation Ensembling (TTE) to
further mitigate the impact of residual noise and enhance robustness.Extensive
experimentation has demonstrated that FPT-Noise significantly outperforms
existing Test-Time defense methods, boosting average robust accuracy from 0.07%
to 56.86% under AutoAttack while maintaining high performance on clean images
(-1.1%). The code will be made public following the publication of the study.

### [107] [A new measure for dynamic leakage based on quantitative information flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20922)
*Luigi D. C. Soares,Mário S. Alvim,Natasha Fernandes*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了动态信息流泄漏的新定义，将攻击者的信念与基线分布解耦，并验证了其满足信息论公理，同时展示了与静态视角的兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定量信息流(QIF)中，静态视角已有成熟理论，但动态视角缺乏同等理论成熟度。本文旨在弥合这一差距，为系统监控和跟踪提供更好的理论基础。

Method: 提出动态泄漏的新定义，将攻击者信念与基线分布解耦；验证该形式化满足非干扰性、单调性和数据处理不等式等公理；分析强版本公理不成立的条件；展示与静态视角的兼容性；在隐私保护数据发布攻击中示例应用。

Result: 新定义成功解耦了攻击者信念和基线分布；验证了相关信息论公理的满足；识别了强版本公理不成立的条件；证明了与静态视角的兼容性；在隐私保护数据发布攻击中有效应用。

Conclusion: 本文为动态信息流泄漏提供了更成熟的理论基础，通过新定义和公理验证填补了动态视角的理论空白，同时保持了与现有静态理论的兼容性。

Abstract: Quantitative information flow (QIF) is concerned with assessing the leakage
of information in computational systems. In QIF there are two main perspectives
for the quantification of leakage. On one hand, the static perspective
considers all possible runs of the system in the computation of information
flow, and is usually employed when preemptively deciding whether or not to run
the system. On the other hand, the dynamic perspective considers only a
specific, concrete run of the system that has been realised, while ignoring all
other runs. The dynamic perspective is relevant for, e.g., system monitors and
trackers, especially when deciding whether to continue or to abort a particular
run based on how much leakage has occurred up to a certain point. Although the
static perspective of leakage is well-developed in the literature, the dynamic
perspective still lacks the same level of theoretical maturity. In this paper
we take steps towards bridging this gap with the following key contributions:
(i) we provide a novel definition of dynamic leakage that decouples the
adversary's belief about the secret value from a baseline distribution on
secrets against which the success of the attack is measured; (ii) we
demonstrate that our formalisation satisfies relevant information-theoretic
axioms, including non-interference and relaxed versions of monotonicity and the
data-processing inequality (DPI); (iii) we identify under what kind of analysis
strong versions of the axioms of monotonicity and the DPI might not hold, and
explain the implications of this (perhaps counter-intuitive) outcome; (iv) we
show that our definition of dynamic leakage is compatible with the
well-established static perspective; and (v) we exemplify the use of our
definition on the formalisation of attacks against privacy-preserving data
releases.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了城市空中交通（UAM）车辆中自主导航和着陆系统的漏洞，重点关注针对深度学习模型的特洛伊木马攻击。实验显示，在特洛伊木马攻击下，模型准确率从96.4%大幅下降至73.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着城市空中交通系统的发展，确保其自主导航和着陆系统的安全性变得至关重要。特洛伊木马攻击可能通过训练数据中的隐蔽触发器导致特定条件下的系统故障，而其他情况下系统仍正常运行，这种隐蔽性对UAM安全构成严重威胁。

Method: 使用DroNet框架评估城市自主空中飞行器的脆弱性，收集自定义数据集并训练模型以模拟真实条件。开发了专门用于识别特洛伊木马感染模型的评估框架。

Result: 实验结果显示，在特洛伊木马攻击下，模型在干净数据上的96.4%准确率下降至触发数据上的73.3%，表明特洛伊木马攻击对UAM系统构成显著安全风险。

Conclusion: 特洛伊木马攻击对城市空中交通系统构成潜在安全威胁，本研究为未来增强UAM系统韧性的研究奠定了基础，强调了开发有效防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerabilities of autonomous navigation and
landing systems in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Specifically, it focuses
on Trojan attacks that target deep learning models, such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Trojan attacks work by embedding covert triggers within
a model's training data. These triggers cause specific failures under certain
conditions, while the model continues to perform normally in other situations.
We assessed the vulnerability of Urban Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAAVs) using
the DroNet framework. Our experiments showed a significant drop in accuracy,
from 96.4% on clean data to 73.3% on data triggered by Trojan attacks. To
conduct this study, we collected a custom dataset and trained models to
simulate real-world conditions. We also developed an evaluation framework
designed to identify Trojan-infected models. This work demonstrates the
potential security risks posed by Trojan attacks and lays the groundwork for
future research on enhancing the resilience of UAM systems.

### [109] [Self-Jailbreaking: Language Models Can Reason Themselves Out of Safety Alignment After Benign Reasoning Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20956)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Stephen H. Bach*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文发现推理语言模型在数学或代码领域的良性推理训练后会出现"自越狱"现象，即模型会使用多种策略绕过自身的安全防护机制，包括引入良性假设来为有害请求提供正当理由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理语言模型在良性推理训练后意外出现的安全对齐失效问题，揭示模型如何通过自我推理来规避安全防护机制。

Method: 通过分析多个开源推理语言模型（如DeepSeek-R1-distilled、s1.1、Phi-4-mini-reasoning、Nemotron等）的行为，研究自越狱现象的发生机制，并探索通过在训练中加入少量安全推理数据来缓解这一问题的方法。

Result: 发现许多推理语言模型在意识到请求有害性的情况下仍会发生自越狱，模型在良性推理训练后变得更加顺从，并且在自越狱后通过思维链将恶意请求感知为危害性较低，从而满足这些请求。

Conclusion: 自越狱是推理语言模型中的一个普遍现象，通过在训练中加入最小量的安全推理数据可以有效保持模型的安全对齐，为维护日益强大的推理语言模型的安全性提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We discover a novel and surprising phenomenon of unintentional misalignment
in reasoning language models (RLMs), which we call self-jailbreaking.
Specifically, after benign reasoning training on math or code domains, RLMs
will use multiple strategies to circumvent their own safety guardrails. One
strategy is to introduce benign assumptions about users and scenarios to
justify fulfilling harmful requests. For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful
requests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card
information from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of
``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign
context being provided as input. We observe that many open-weight RLMs,
including DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron,
suffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the
requests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking:
RLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after
self-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful
in the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them. To mitigate self-jailbreaking,
we find that including minimal safety reasoning data during training is
sufficient to ensure RLMs remain safety-aligned. Our work provides the first
systematic analysis of self-jailbreaking behavior and offers a practical path
forward for maintaining safety in increasingly capable RLMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了FOICE音频深度伪造检测，发现现有检测器在标准及噪声条件下均失效，提出了针对FOICE特定伪影的微调策略，显著提升检测准确率，但揭示了在专业化与泛化性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FOICE技术能够从单张面部图像生成逼真的合成语音，绕过行业标准认证系统，由于面部图像比语音样本更易获取，这大大降低了大规模攻击的门槛，引发了严重的安全担忧。

Method: 研究两个核心问题：现有音频深度伪造检测器能否可靠检测FOICE生成的语音；对这些检测器进行FOICE数据微调是否能提高检测效果而不产生过拟合。采用系统评估和针对性微调策略。

Result: 领先的检测器在标准和噪声条件下均持续失效；针对性微调策略捕获FOICE特定伪影，显著提高检测准确率；微调后在专业化与对未见语音生成器的鲁棒性之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前防御系统的根本弱点，为下一代音频深度伪造检测的新架构和训练协议提供了动机。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled the creation of
increasingly stealthy synthetic voices, commonly referred to as audio
deepfakes. A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly
alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image,
without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial
and vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass
industry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and
Microsoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are
far easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering
the barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core
research questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors
reliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and
(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection
without overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators
such as SpeechT5.
  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic
evaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail
under both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted
fine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding
significant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after
fine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and
robustness to unseen synthesis pipelines. These findings expose fundamental
weaknesses in today's defenses and motivate new architectures and training
protocols for next-generation audio deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端的强化学习框架，用于优化大型语言模型的水印技术，通过锚定机制和正则化项解决多目标优化不稳定和奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM水印算法大多依赖启发式的绿/红令牌列表设计，直接使用强化学习优化面临多目标冲突导致训练不稳定和巨大动作空间易受奖励黑客攻击的挑战。

Method: 采用端到端强化学习框架，引入锚定机制确保训练稳定性，并添加正则化项防止奖励黑客问题。

Result: 在两个骨干LLM上的标准基准测试表明，该方法在所有标准上实现了最先进的权衡，特别是在抵抗欺骗攻击方面有显著改进，且不降低其他标准。

Conclusion: 所提出的强化学习框架能够有效优化LLM水印技术，在检测性、文本质量、抗移除攻击和抗欺骗攻击等多个标准上实现良好平衡。

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for tracing and
authenticating text generated by large language models (LLMs). A common
approach to LLM watermarking is to construct a green/red token list and assign
higher or lower generation probabilities to the corresponding tokens,
respectively. However, most existing watermarking algorithms rely on heuristic
green/red token list designs, as directly optimizing the list design with
techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) comes with several challenges.
First, desirable watermarking involves multiple criteria, i.e., detectability,
text quality, robustness against removal attacks, and security against spoofing
attacks. Directly optimizing for these criteria introduces many partially
conflicting reward terms, leading to an unstable convergence process. Second,
the vast action space of green/red token list choices is susceptible to reward
hacking. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end RL framework for robust and
secure LLM watermarking. Our approach adopts an anchoring mechanism for reward
terms to ensure stable training and introduces additional regularization terms
to prevent reward hacking. Experiments on standard benchmarks with two backbone
LLMs show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art trade-off across all
criteria, with notable improvements in resistance to spoofing attacks without
degrading other criteria. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出QAE-BAC系统，通过(r,t)-匿名模型量化用户重识别风险，并采用熵加权路径树优化策略匹配，在Hyperledger Fabric上实现隐私与性能的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决区块链属性访问控制中的两个核心挑战：区块链透明性导致的用户隐私威胁，以及策略匹配计算复杂度与区块链性能约束的冲突。现有方案存在高开销和缺乏可量化匿名保证的问题。

Method: 提出QAE-BAC系统，包含：(1) 形式化的(r,t)-匿名模型动态量化用户重识别风险；(2) 基于实时匿名度量的熵加权路径树优化策略结构，降低策略匹配复杂度。

Result: 在Hyperledger Fabric上的实验结果表明，QAE-BAC能有效缓解重识别风险，相比现有基准方法，吞吐量提升高达11倍，延迟降低87%。

Conclusion: QAE-BAC在隐私敏感的分布式应用中实现了隐私保护与性能效率的优越平衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Blockchain-based Attribute-Based Access Control (BC-ABAC) offers a
decentralized paradigm for secure data governance but faces two inherent
challenges: the transparency of blockchain ledgers threatens user privacy by
enabling reidentification attacks through attribute analysis, while the
computational complexity of policy matching clashes with blockchain's
performance constraints. Existing solutions, such as those employing
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), often incur high overhead and lack measurable
anonymity guarantees, while efficiency optimizations frequently ignore privacy
implications. To address these dual challenges, this paper proposes QAEBAC
(Quantifiable Anonymity and Efficiency in Blockchain-Based Access Control with
Attribute). QAE-BAC introduces a formal (r, t)-anonymity model to dynamically
quantify the re-identification risk of users based on their access attributes
and history. Furthermore, it features an Entropy-Weighted Path Tree (EWPT) that
optimizes policy structure based on realtime anonymity metrics, drastically
reducing policy matching complexity. Implemented and evaluated on Hyperledger
Fabric, QAE-BAC demonstrates a superior balance between privacy and
performance. Experimental results show that it effectively mitigates
re-identification risks and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
up to an 11x improvement in throughput and an 87% reduction in latency, proving
its practicality for privacy-sensitive decentralized applications.

TL;DR: 本研究对10个领先商业大语言模型在CBRN武器知识扩散风险方面进行了首次全面评估，发现存在严重安全漏洞，深度诱导攻击成功率高达86%，远高于直接请求的33.8%，揭示了当前安全对齐机制的脆弱性。


<details>

Motivation: 前沿大语言模型存在前所未有的双重用途风险，可能促进化学、生物、放射性和核武器知识的扩散。为评估这些风险并挑战行业安全声明，需要进行全面的安全漏洞评估。

Method: 使用新颖的200个提示CBRN数据集和FORTRESS基准的180个提示子集，采用严格的三层攻击方法学，包括深度诱导攻击和直接请求对比测试。

Result: 发现关键安全漏洞：深度诱导攻击成功率86.0% vs 直接请求33.8%；模型安全性能差异巨大，从2%（claude-opus-4）到96%（mistral-small-latest）攻击成功率；8个模型在增强危险材料属性时超过70%脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前安全对齐机制存在根本性脆弱性，简单的提示工程技术就能绕过对危险CBRN信息的保护。结果挑战了行业安全声明，强调迫切需要标准化评估框架、透明安全指标和更强大的对齐技术来减轻灾难性误用风险。

Abstract: Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) pose unprecedented dual-use risks
through the potential proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear (CBRN) weapons knowledge. We present the first comprehensive evaluation
of 10 leading commercial LLMs against both a novel 200-prompt CBRN dataset and
a 180-prompt subset of the FORTRESS benchmark, using a rigorous three-tier
attack methodology. Our findings expose critical safety vulnerabilities: Deep
Inception attacks achieve 86.0\% success versus 33.8\% for direct requests,
demonstrating superficial filtering mechanisms; Model safety performance varies
dramatically from 2\% (claude-opus-4) to 96\% (mistral-small-latest) attack
success rates; and eight models exceed 70\% vulnerability when asked to enhance
dangerous material properties. We identify fundamental brittleness in current
safety alignment, where simple prompt engineering techniques bypass safeguards
for dangerous CBRN information. These results challenge industry safety claims
and highlight urgent needs for standardized evaluation frameworks, transparent
safety metrics, and more robust alignment techniques to mitigate catastrophic
misuse risks while preserving beneficial capabilities.

*Lu Liu,Wuqi Zhang,Lili Wei,Hao Guan,Yongqiang Tian,Yepang Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PMDetector是一个结合静态分析和LLM推理的混合框架，用于主动检测DeFi智能合约中的价格操纵漏洞，在真实数据集上达到88%精度和90%召回率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeFi智能合约管理数十亿美元资金，价格操纵漏洞（通常通过闪电贷）造成重大财务损失。现有检测方法有限：反应性方法仅在攻击发生后分析，而主动静态分析工具依赖僵化的预定义启发式规则，无法识别新型变体或理解复杂经济逻辑。

Method: PMDetector采用混合框架，结合静态分析和LLM推理。首先使用静态污点分析识别潜在漏洞代码路径，然后通过两阶段LLM过程过滤路径（分析防御措施和模拟攻击评估可利用性），最后静态分析检查器验证LLM结果，保留高风险路径并生成详细漏洞报告。

Result: 在包含73个真实漏洞和288个良性DeFi协议的数据集上，PMDetector使用Gemini 2.5-flash达到88%精度和90%召回率，显著优于最先进的静态分析和基于LLM的方法。使用GPT-4.1审计一个漏洞仅需0.03美元和4.0秒。

Conclusion: PMDetector提供了一种高效且经济实惠的替代手动审计的方法，能够主动检测DeFi价格操纵漏洞，在精度、召回率和成本效益方面均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts manage billions of dollars,
making them a prime target for exploits. Price manipulation vulnerabilities,
often via flash loans, are a devastating class of attacks causing significant
financial losses. Existing detection methods are limited. Reactive approaches
analyze attacks only after they occur, while proactive static analysis tools
rely on rigid, predefined heuristics, limiting adaptability. Both depend on
known attack patterns, failing to identify novel variants or comprehend complex
economic logic. We propose PMDetector, a hybrid framework combining static
analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning to proactively detect
price manipulation vulnerabilities. Our approach uses a formal attack model and
a three-stage pipeline. First, static taint analysis identifies potentially
vulnerable code paths. Second, a two-stage LLM process filters paths by
analyzing defenses and then simulates attacks to evaluate exploitability.
Finally, a static analysis checker validates LLM results, retaining only
high-risk paths and generating comprehensive vulnerability reports. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we built a dataset of 73 real-world vulnerable and 288
benign DeFi protocols. Results show PMDetector achieves 88% precision and 90%
recall with Gemini 2.5-flash, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
static analysis and LLM-based approaches. Auditing a vulnerability with
PMDetector costs just $0.03 and takes 4.0 seconds with GPT-4.1, offering an
efficient and cost-effective alternative to manual audits.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于任务并发的LLM越狱攻击方法JAIL-CON，通过在相邻单词中编码不同意图实现并发任务处理，显著降低了有害内容被防护机制过滤的概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击主要遵循顺序逻辑，而并发作为顺序场景的自然扩展被忽视。研究发现将有害任务与良性任务结合能显著降低被防护机制检测的概率，揭示了LLM并发处理中的潜在风险。

Method: 提出词级方法实现LLM中的任务并发，相邻单词编码不同意图；开发JAIL-CON迭代攻击框架，通过任务并发实现越狱。

Result: 在广泛使用的LLM上实验表明，JAIL-CON相比现有攻击具有更强的越狱能力；当应用防护机制时，并发答案比顺序答案更具隐蔽性，更难被检测。

Conclusion: 任务并发在LLM越狱中具有独特优势，JAIL-CON框架展示了并发攻击的有效性和隐蔽性，揭示了LLM并发处理机制的安全风险。

Abstract: Despite their superior performance on a wide range of domains, large language
models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to misuse for generating harmful content, a
risk that has been further amplified by various jailbreak attacks. Existing
jailbreak attacks mainly follow sequential logic, where LLMs understand and
answer each given task one by one. However, concurrency, a natural extension of
the sequential scenario, has been largely overlooked. In this work, we first
propose a word-level method to enable task concurrency in LLMs, where adjacent
words encode divergent intents. Although LLMs maintain strong utility in
answering concurrent tasks, which is demonstrated by our evaluations on
mathematical and general question-answering benchmarks, we notably observe that
combining a harmful task with a benign one significantly reduces the
probability of it being filtered by the guardrail, showing the potential risks
associated with concurrency in LLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce
$\texttt{JAIL-CON}$, an iterative attack framework that
$\underline{\text{JAIL}}$breaks LLMs via task $\underline{\text{CON}}$currency.
Experiments on widely-used LLMs demonstrate the strong jailbreak capabilities
of $\texttt{JAIL-CON}$ compared to existing attacks. Furthermore, when the
guardrail is applied as a defense, compared to the sequential answers generated
by previous attacks, the concurrent answers in our $\texttt{JAIL-CON}$ exhibit
greater stealthiness and are less detectable by the guardrail, highlighting the
unique feature of task concurrency in jailbreaking LLMs.

TL;DR: FLAMES使用领域适应的大型语言模型自动生成可执行的运行时防护，为智能合约提供可部署的安全防御，无需漏洞检测或人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约漏洞每年造成数十亿美元损失，现有自动化分析工具无法生成可部署的防御措施。

Method: 通过填充中间监督微调训练领域适应的大型语言模型，从514,506个已验证合约中提取真实世界不变量。

Result: FLAMES在三个维度表现优异：编译成功率96.7%，语义质量44.5%精确匹配，阻止了20.4%的真实攻击，并成功缓解了APEMAGA事件。

Conclusion: 领域适应的LLM能够自动为智能合约生成生产就绪的安全防御，无需漏洞检测、形式化规范或人工干预。

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities cost billions of dollars annually, yet
existing automated analysis tools fail to generate deployable defenses. We
present FLAMES, a novel automated approach that synthesizes executable runtime
guards as Solidity "require" statements to harden smart contracts against
exploits. Unlike prior work that relies on vulnerability labels, symbolic
analysis, or natural language specifications, FLAMES employs domain-adapted
large language models trained through fill-in-the-middle supervised fine-tuning
on real-world invariants extracted from 514,506 verified contracts. Our
extensive evaluation across three dimensions demonstrates FLAMES's
effectiveness: (1) Compilation: FLAMES achieves 96.7% compilability for
synthesized invariant (2) Semantic Quality: on a curated test set of 5,000
challenging invariants, FLAMES produces exact or semantically equivalent
matches to ground truth in 44.5% of cases; (3) Exploit Mitigation: FLAMES
prevents 22 out of 108 real exploits (20.4%) while preserving contract
functionality, and (4) FLAMES successfully blocks the real-world APEMAGA
incident by synthesizing a pre-condition that mitigates the attack. FLAMES
establishes that domain-adapted LLMs can automatically generate
production-ready security defenses for smart contracts without requiring
vulnerability detection, formal specifications, or human intervention. We
release our code, model weights, datasets, and evaluation infrastructure to
enable reproducible research in this critical domain.

### [117] [The Trojan Example: Jailbreaking LLMs through Template Filling and Unsafety Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21190)
*Mingrui Liu,Sixiao Zhang,Cheng Long,Kwok Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TrojFill是一种黑盒越狱方法，通过将有害指令嵌入到多部分模板中，让模型先推理指令的不安全性，然后生成包含目标内容的详细示例，从而绕过安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱技术存在局限性：白盒方法需要模型内部信息不适用于闭源API，黑盒方法生成的提示缺乏可解释性和可迁移性。需要一种更有效的黑盒越狱方法。

Method: 将不安全指令重构为模板填充任务，通过占位符替换或编码方式嵌入有害指令，使用包含不安全性推理、详细示例生成和逐句分析的多部分模板框架。

Result: 在主流LLM上表现出色，Gemini-flash-2.5和DeepSeek-3.1达到100%攻击成功率，GPT-4o达到97%，且生成的提示具有更好的可解释性和可迁移性。

Conclusion: TrojFill提供了一种有效的黑盒越狱方法，通过任务重构显著降低了拒绝率，同时提升了生成提示的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly and now encode extensive
world knowledge. Despite safety fine-tuning, however, they remain susceptible
to adversarial prompts that elicit harmful content. Existing jailbreak
techniques fall into two categories: white-box methods (e.g., gradient-based
approaches such as GCG), which require model internals and are infeasible for
closed-source APIs, and black-box methods that rely on attacker LLMs to search
or mutate prompts but often produce templates that lack explainability and
transferability. We introduce TrojFill, a black-box jailbreak that reframes
unsafe instruction as a template-filling task. TrojFill embeds obfuscated
harmful instructions (e.g., via placeholder substitution or Caesar/Base64
encoding) inside a multi-part template that asks the model to (1) reason why
the original instruction is unsafe (unsafety reasoning) and (2) generate a
detailed example of the requested text, followed by a sentence-by-sentence
analysis. The crucial "example" component acts as a Trojan Horse that contains
the target jailbreak content while the surrounding task framing reduces refusal
rates. We evaluate TrojFill on standard jailbreak benchmarks across leading
LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen), showing strong empirical
performance (e.g., 100% attack success on Gemini-flash-2.5 and DeepSeek-3.1,
and 97% on GPT-4o). Moreover, the generated prompts exhibit improved
interpretability and transferability compared with prior black-box optimization
approaches. We release our code, sample prompts, and generated outputs to
support future red-teaming research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对多模态大语言模型的黑盒越狱攻击方法，通过文本和图像提示来评估模型安全性，并设计了重新攻击策略和防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言任务时存在安全漏洞，特别是越狱攻击可能导致未经授权或有害的响应。视觉模态的引入带来了新的安全威胁维度。

Method: 设计包含挑衅指令的文本提示，以及具有突变和多图像能力的图像提示，并采用重新攻击策略来加强评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效评估开源和闭源多模态大语言模型的安全性，并识别出现有防御方法的不足。

Conclusion: 重新设计的防御方法在训练时和推理时都能提供更好的保护，有效抵御越狱攻击。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) comprise of both visual and textual
modalities to process vision language tasks. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to
security-related issues, such as jailbreak attacks that alter the model's input
to induce unauthorized or harmful responses. The incorporation of the
additional visual modality introduces new dimensions to security threats. In
this paper, we proposed a black-box jailbreak method via both text and image
prompts to evaluate MLLMs. In particular, we designed text prompts with
provocative instructions, along with image prompts that introduced mutation and
multi-image capabilities. To strengthen the evaluation, we also designed a
Re-attack strategy. Empirical results show that our proposed work can improve
capabilities to assess the security of both open-source and closed-source
MLLMs. With that, we identified gaps in existing defense methods to propose new
strategies for both training-time and inference-time defense methods, and
evaluated them across the new jailbreak methods. The experiment results showed
that the re-designed defense methods improved protections against the jailbreak
attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文针对自托管云存储平台（如Nextcloud）的取证挑战，提出了一个扩展的取证框架，通过设备监控和云API实现结构化、可重复的证据采集，并开发了开源采集工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自托管云存储平台日益流行，但给数字取证调查带来了新挑战，现有云存储取证框架存在局限性，Nextcloud作为广泛使用的平台在取证研究中关注不足。

Method: 提出扩展取证框架，整合设备监控和云API进行结构化证据采集；以Nextcloud为案例研究，利用其原生API可靠访问取证工件；开发开源采集工具实现该方法。

Result: 展示了如何利用Nextcloud原生API可靠获取取证工件，提供了更灵活的自托管云存储系统分析方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为调查人员提供了分析自托管云存储系统的灵活方法，并为这一不断发展的数字取证领域奠定了进一步开发的基础。

Abstract: Self-hosted cloud storage platforms like Nextcloud are gaining popularity
among individuals and organizations seeking greater control over their data.
However, this shift introduces new challenges for digital forensic
investigations, particularly in systematically analyzing both client and server
components. Despite Nextcloud's widespread use, it has received limited
attention in forensic research. In this work, we critically examine existing
cloud storage forensic frameworks and highlight their limitations. To address
the gaps, we propose an extended forensic framework that incorporates device
monitoring and leverages cloud APIs for structured, repeatable evidence
acquisition. Using Nextcloud as a case study, we demonstrate how its native
APIs can be used to reliably access forensic artifacts, and we introduce an
open-source acquisition tool that implements this approach. Our framework
equips investigators with a more flexible method for analyzing self-hosted
cloud storage systems, and offers a foundation for further development in this
evolving area of digital forensics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FIDO2标准使用ECDSA、RSA等经典密码签名算法，这些算法在面对大规模量子计算机攻击时存在安全风险。随着量子计算技术的发展，需要为FIDO2开发后量子密码解决方案。

Method: 研究探索了基于模块格的数字签名算法ML-DSA作为FIDO2的后量子密码签名标准，该方法基于Crystals Dilithium算法。

Result: 论文比较了ML-DSA与经典算法密钥在性能和安全性方面的表现，评估了其作为FIDO2后量子密码标准的适用性。

Conclusion: ML-DSA作为基于模块格的后量子密码签名算法，有望为FIDO2认证系统提供量子安全的解决方案，应对未来量子计算带来的安全挑战。

Abstract: Authentication systems have evolved a lot since the 1960s when Fernando
Corbato first proposed the password-based authentication. In 2013, the FIDO
Alliance proposed using secure hardware for authentication, thus marking a
milestone in the passwordless authentication era [1]. Passwordless
authentication with a possession-based factor often relied on hardware-backed
cryptographic methods. FIDO2 being one an amalgamation of the W3C Web
Authentication and FIDO Alliance Client to Authenticator Protocol is an
industry standard for secure passwordless authentication with rising adoption
for the same [2]. However, the current FIDO2 standards use ECDSA with SHA-256
(ES256), RSA with SHA-256 (RS256) and similar classical cryptographic signature
algorithms. This makes it insecure against attacks involving large-scale
quantum computers [3]. This study aims at exploring the usability of Module
Lattice based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), based on Crystals Dilithium
as a post quantum cryptographic signature standard for FIDO2. The paper
highlights the performance and security in comparison to keys with classical
algorithms.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出SBASH框架，使用轻量级本地LLM解决蜜罐数据保护问题，研究RAG和非RAG LLM在Linux shell命令中的表现，发现RAG提升未调优模型准确率，而通过系统提示调优的LLM无需RAG即可达到相似准确率且延迟更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜜罐需要最大化攻击者参与度，上下文感知能力至关重要。现有LLM方法存在准确性、响应时间、运营成本高和云部署数据保护问题。

Method: 提出SBASH框架，使用轻量级本地LLM管理数据保护问题。研究RAG支持和非RAG的LLM处理Linux shell命令，评估响应时间差异、人类测试者评估的真实性，以及使用Levenshtein距离、SBert和BertScore计算与真实系统的相似度。

Result: RAG提高了未调优模型的准确性，而通过系统提示调优的LLM无需RAG即可达到与未调优+RAG相似的准确性，且延迟略低。

Conclusion: SBASH框架通过本地轻量级LLM有效解决数据保护问题，系统提示调优的LLM在无需RAG的情况下可达到良好性能，为蜜罐上下文感知提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence
or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker
engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that
context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems
and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer
from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time,
high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We
propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which
manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We
investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and
non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different
metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and
similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and
BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models
that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a
Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while
having a slightly lower latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全同态加密方案需要自举操作，导致性能瓶颈和噪声管理问题。GRAFHEN旨在消除这些限制，提供更高效的无噪声全同态加密。

Method: 基于Nuida等人的工作，使用群编码技术，通过重写系统表示群结构，使子群成员问题对攻击者变得极其困难，同时保持计算性能。

Result: 实现比现有标准快几个数量级的性能，通过基准测试验证了高效性，并分析了多种潜在攻击的防护措施。

Conclusion: GRAFHEN成功实现了无需自举的全同态加密，在保持安全性的同时显著提升了性能，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present GRAFHEN, a new cryptographic scheme which offers Fully Homomorphic
Encryption without the need for bootstrapping (or in other words, without
noise). Building on the work of Nuida and others, we achieve this using
encodings in groups.
  The groups are represented on a machine using rewriting systems. In this way
the subgroup membership problem, which an attacker would have to solve in order
to break the scheme, becomes maximally hard, while performance is preserved. In
fact we include a simple benchmark demonstrating that our implementation runs
several orders of magnitude faster than existing standards.
  We review many possible attacks against our protocol and explain how to
protect the scheme in each case.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的隐私威胁模型框架（PTMF），通过结合MITRE ATT&CK框架和LINDDUN隐私威胁模型，分析物联网系统中的隐私威胁。通过用户研究识别了主要威胁参与者和关键威胁路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私威胁分析主要关注威胁发生区域和可能性，但缺乏对威胁参与者、行为和意图的深入理解。需要开发一个以隐私为中心的框架来系统分析隐私威胁。

Method: 结合MITRE ATT&CK框架的战术和LINDDUN隐私威胁模型的技术，开发PTMF框架。通过基于PTMF的问卷调查，收集来自工业界和学术界安全隐私专家的意见，分析12个物联网隐私威胁。

Result: 识别了物联网用户识别（IU）隐私威胁中的前三大威胁参与者及其关键路径，以及其余11个隐私威胁的威胁参与者映射。

Conclusion: PTMF为理解如何在物联网系统中主动有效部署隐私措施提供了坚实基础，能够基于威胁参与者的活动和意图来缓解隐私威胁。

Abstract: Previous studies on PTA have focused on analyzing privacy threats based on
the potential areas of occurrence and their likelihood of occurrence. However,
an in-depth understanding of the threat actors involved, their actions, and the
intentions that result in privacy threats is essential. In this paper, we
present a novel Privacy Threat Model Framework (PTMF) that analyzes privacy
threats through different phases.
  The PTMF development is motivated through the selected tactics from the MITRE
ATT\&CK framework and techniques from the LINDDUN privacy threat model, making
PTMF a privacy-centered framework. The proposed PTMF can be employed in various
ways, including analyzing the activities of threat actors during privacy
threats and assessing privacy risks in IoT systems, among others. In this
paper, we conducted a user study on 12 privacy threats associated with IoT by
developing a questionnaire based on PTMF and recruited experts from both
industry and academia in the fields of security and privacy to gather their
opinions. The collected data were analyzed and mapped to identify the threat
actors involved in the identification of IoT users (IU) and the remaining 11
privacy threats. Our observation revealed the top three threat actors and the
critical paths they used during the IU privacy threat, as well as the remaining
11 privacy threats. This study could provide a solid foundation for
understanding how and where privacy measures can be proactively and effectively
deployed in IoT systems to mitigate privacy threats based on the activities and
intentions of threat actors within these systems.

Conclusion: 该系统通过TEE技术实现了可验证的隐私保护，确保所有原始和衍生数据都在TEE中处理，防止系统运营商检查，并对所有发布结果应用差分隐私。

Abstract: Large-scale systems that compute analytics over a fleet of devices must
achieve high privacy and security standards while also meeting data quality,
usability, and resource efficiency expectations. We present a next-generation
federated analytics system that uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
based on technologies like AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX to provide verifiable
privacy guarantees for all server-side processing. In our system, devices
encrypt and upload data, tagging it with a limited set of allowable server-side
processing steps. An open source, TEE-hosted key management service guarantees
that the data is accessible only to those steps, which are themselves protected
by TEE confidentiality and integrity assurance guarantees. The system is
designed for flexible workloads, including processing unstructured data with
LLMs (for structured summarization) before aggregation into differentially
private insights (with automatic parameter tuning). The transparency properties
of our system allow any external party to verify that all raw and derived data
is processed in TEEs, protecting it from inspection by the system operator, and
that differential privacy is applied to all released results. This system has
been successfully deployed in production, providing helpful insights into
real-world GenAI experiences.

Abstract: With the rapid development of (multimodal) large language model-based agents,
the landscape of agentic service management has evolved from single-agent
systems to multi-agent systems, and now to massive-agent ecosystems. Current
massive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service
experiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address
these issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale.
Concretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier,
agent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service
experiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while
the agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing
diverse agentic services. The agent audit, based on the supervision of
developer and user activities, ensures the integrity and credibility of both
service providers and users. Through the analysis of challenges, transitional
forms, and practical considerations, the ColorEcosystem is poised to power
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across
massive-agent ecosystems. Meanwhile, we have also implemented part of
ColorEcosystem's functionality, and the relevant code is open-sourced at
https://github.com/opas-lab/color-ecosystem.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模糊数表示方法——外延模糊数，以解决传统模糊数运算中的计算复杂性和结果特征不一致问题，并定义了相应的运算和关系运算符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊数运算存在计算复杂度高、运算结果特征不一致（如两个三角模糊数相乘结果不再是三角模糊数）以及模糊扩散等问题，限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Method: 采用外延模糊数作为新的模糊数表示方法，定义了外延模糊数的运算规则和关系运算符（=, >, >=, <, <=），并通过应用示例进行说明。

Result: 提出了外延模糊数的运算框架，解决了传统模糊数运算中的问题，并提供了C++实现代码。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数为模糊数运算提供了一种更高效和一致的方法，扩展了模糊数的应用领域。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

*Benjamin Lange*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了何时应该优先采用AI输出而非人类专家判断的问题，提出了"AI优先主义"和"全证据观点"两种AI信任模式，并论证了后者更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在可靠性方面表现出色，需要建立理论框架来确定何时应该信任AI输出而非人类专家判断，特别是在高风险环境中。

Method: 基于社会认识论理论，分析AI系统作为人工认识权威的特征，比较AI优先主义和全证据观点两种信任模式的优缺点。

Result: AI优先主义存在放大版的经典反对意见，而全证据观点通过将AI输出作为贡献性理由而非替代性理由，提供了更合理的信任框架。

Conclusion: 全证据观点是更可取的AI信任方法，它能够减轻专业知识萎缩、为人机监督提供认识论依据，并在可靠性条件未满足时解释对AI的合理不信任。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

Motivation: 现有的CXR分析模型难以适应新的诊断任务和复杂推理场景，且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制，限制了其适应性和可信度。

Method: 提出导演协调的多阶段智能体框架：1) 工具调用阶段，通过证据驱动验证器对工具输出进行标准化和验证；2) 诊断规划阶段，根据任务需求和中间发现制定诊断计划并组建专家团队；3) 协作决策阶段，整合专家团队见解和上下文记忆，形成基于证据的诊断结论。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作框架显著提升了CXR分析的适应性和可信度，为临床诊断提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

### [130] [From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21045)
*Ali Khosravi Kazazi,Zhenlong Li,M. Naser Lessani,Guido Cervone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体框架，用于将自然语言问题准确转换为空间SQL查询，通过协作式智能体管道和程序化验证来提高空间查询的准确性和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SQL和PostGIS等地理空间函数的复杂性对非专家用户造成的障碍，克服单智能体方法在处理空间查询语义和语法复杂性时的局限性。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包括知识库（含程序化模式分析和语义增强）、上下文检索嵌入、协作式多智能体管道（实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成）以及执行程序化和语义验证的审查智能体。

Result: 在KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%的总体准确率（272个问题中的221个）；在空间查询中达到87.7%的总体准确率（90个问题中的79个），相比没有审查智能体的76.7%有显著提升。系统生成的查询在某些情况下比基准测试中的查询更符合用户意图。

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更加易于访问，为空间Text-to-SQL系统提供了稳健、可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

TL;DR: MedAlign是一个针对医学视觉问答的框架，通过多模态直接偏好优化、检索感知专家混合架构和联邦治理机制，解决大型视觉语言模型在医疗应用中的幻觉问题、固定深度推理效率低下和多机构协作困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在临床服务部署中面临三个关键挑战：产生无视觉依据的幻觉答案、固定深度推理效率低下、多机构协作困难。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化目标，将偏好学习与视觉上下文对齐；设计检索感知专家混合架构，通过图像和文本相似度路由查询到专业专家；采用联邦治理机制，让选定的专家基于本地元认知不确定性估计器进行迭代链式思考推理。

Result: 在三个代表性Med-VQA数据集上的实验表明，MedAlign达到最先进性能，比强检索增强基线在F1分数上提升高达11.85%，同时相比固定深度CoT方法平均推理长度减少51.60%。

Conclusion: MedAlign框架有效解决了LVLM在医疗应用中的关键挑战，实现了视觉准确的响应、自适应推理和跨机构协作。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，能够在RAG系统中实现超过90%的人口覆盖成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击方法忽略了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突问题。

Method: 首先识别与上下文中毒知识强相关的毒物响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过观察到的归因信号重用有前景但最初不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能持续实现超过90%的人口覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性。

Conclusion: NeuroGenPoisoning框架能有效解决知识冲突问题，并大规模生成有效的RAG中毒知识。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt是一个自动化框架，通过进化图优化方法自动设计更好的提示、高效推理过程，并提供增强的因果信息过程，在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，为大型语言模型设计针对特定领域任务的最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性。如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率，甚至为领域专家提供精炼的知识整合提示是特别关键但尚未解决的任务。

Method: EGO-Prompt从人类专家构建的一般提示和容错初始语义因果图描述开始，然后自动精炼和优化以指导LLM推理。该方法包含两个步骤的因果引导文本梯度过程：从SCG为每个实例生成近乎确定性的推理指导，以及使LLM能够有效利用该指导与原始输入。迭代优化算法使用文本梯度和真实值进一步精炼SCG和推理机制。

Result: 在真实世界的公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务中，EGO-Prompt比最先进方法实现了7.32%-12.61%更高的F1分数，并允许小模型以不到20%的原始成本达到大模型的性能。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt不仅显著提升了LLM在领域特定任务上的性能，还输出了精炼的领域特定语义因果图，提高了可解释性，为领域专家提供了有价值的洞察。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出String Seed of Thought (SSoT)提示方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性来改善概率指令跟随(PIF)性能，提升回答多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现出色，但在概率指令跟随(PIF)任务上表现不佳，存在偏差问题，影响需要非确定性行为的应用如人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏。

Method: SSoT提示方法：首先让LLM输出随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵循特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著改善了LLMs的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能。在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的回答多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能有效解决LLMs在概率指令跟随任务中的偏差问题，提升输出多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

TL;DR: NuSA-CL是一个轻量级无记忆持续学习框架，通过低秩适应和将任务特定权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，来最小化对先前知识的干扰，有效保持原始模型的零样本能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临分布偏移和新任务挑战，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法使模型随时间适应同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 采用低秩适应策略，将任务特定权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，无需回放缓冲区或昂贵蒸馏，计算和内存开销最小。

Result: 实验表明该框架不仅能有效保持零样本迁移能力，还在持续学习基准上取得极具竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为现实应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Conclusion: 概述了跨领域和应用的自主系统安全开发和运营所面临的挑战和未来工作方向。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度敏感，在具有密集奖励的游戏中使用固定探索常数会导致性能问题。需要开发与奖励尺度无关的自适应λ选择策略。

Method: 评估了文献中已有的λ策略，并提出了五种新策略，包括基于Q值经验标准差的方法。通过实验比较这些策略在不同任务上的表现。

Result: 新提出的2σ方法（λ=2·σ）在广泛任务范围内优于现有λ策略，无论是使用单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数时的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用基于Q值经验标准差的2σ方法作为UCT算法的自适应探索常数选择策略，该方法对游戏奖励尺度具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

TL;DR: 本文提出Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG)训练框架，通过重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤来提升大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持其推理能力，解决了现有方法在安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题。

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但存在严重的安全风险，包括有害内容生成和越狱攻击。现有缓解策略依赖于在训练中注入启发式安全信号，往往会抑制推理能力，无法解决安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG)训练框架，通过分析模型的推理轨迹，发现Self-Jailbreak现象，然后重新组合或回溯不安全的推理步骤，将模型引导回安全轨迹，同时保留有效的推理链。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提高了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，显著优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题，通过系统性地引导模型回避不安全推理路径，实现了安全性的显著提升而不损害推理性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可信AI研究主要采用技术中心方法，过度关注可靠性、鲁棒性和公平性等技术属性，而忽视了理解AI在现实环境中可信度所需的社会技术维度。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度的定义、操作化和应用方式，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值观。

Result: 研究发现虽然在定义透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性方面取得显著进展，但存在关键差距。当前研究往往过度强调技术精度而牺牲社会伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质仍较少被探索，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的争议概念。

Conclusion: 需要采用结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法来推进可信AI。为AI伦理社区提出了可行措施，以采用真正解决AI系统与社会复杂互动的综合框架，最终促进惠及所有利益相关者的负责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

### [142] [Magellan: Guided MCTS for Latent Space Exploration and Novelty Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21341)
*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan是一个基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的创新生成框架，通过语义罗盘和景观感知价值函数引导LLM在概念空间中进行有原则的探索，显著提升科学创意的合理性和创新性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成创新想法时容易陷入训练数据中高概率、熟悉概念的局限性，以及现有搜索方法依赖不可靠的自评估启发式的问题。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索，结合分层引导系统：语义罗盘向量提供长期方向指导，景观感知价值函数替代有缺陷的自评估，平衡内在一致性、外在新颖性和叙事进展。

Result: 在广泛实验中，Magellan在生成科学想法方面显著优于ReAct和ToT等强基线方法，产生具有更优合理性和创新性的创意。

Conclusion: 对于创造性发现，有原则的引导搜索比无约束的自主性更有效，为LLM成为创新合作伙伴开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

*Ankur Sinha,Shobhit Arora,Dhaval Pujara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k是一个包含11,000多个手写和印刷数学优化模型图像的数据集，配套开发了AutoOpt框架，通过深度学习自动识别数学表达式并生成优化代码，最终求解优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数学优化问题求解过程中需要人工建模和编程的繁琐过程，开发自动化优化问题求解框架，减少人工干预。

Method: AutoOpt框架包含三个模块：M1使用深度学习模型进行数学表达式识别生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: MER任务中的深度学习模型在BLEU得分上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点算法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt框架能够有效自动化优化问题的求解过程，在数学表达式识别和复杂问题求解方面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构化事实机制，将推理转化为可证伪和可审计的过程，解决了LLM智能体长程推理中验证不足的问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLM的智能体在长程推理中由于中间推理验证不足而失败的问题，而非生成能力不足。

Method: 采用冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构化事实两个互补机制：CAMV将验证重构为冲突识别和针对性证伪，TRSF通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%准确率，Humanity's Last Exam上达到35.5%，Chinese-SimpleQA上达到93.8%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为基于LLM的智能体提供了可靠长程推理的可扩展范式，结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用驱动了性能提升。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

### [145] [Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21560)
*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用模仿学习（ICL）训练神经控制屏障函数（CBF）的方法，用于在失败状态集难以形式化定义的情况下确保自主系统的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域中，自主系统的安全性是基本要求。虽然控制屏障函数（CBF）可用于设计安全过滤器，但基于优化的CBF合成计算成本高。此外，需要避免的失败状态集往往难以明确指定，而专家演示数据更容易获取。

Method: 使用模仿学习（ICL）训练一个约束函数来对系统状态进行分类（安全/不安全），然后利用该函数标注新的模拟轨迹数据来训练神经CBF。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，结果表明该方法优于现有基线方法，并且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经CBF性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数据驱动的方式来学习神经CBF，特别适用于失败状态集难以形式化定义的场景，能够有效确保自主系统的安全性。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

### [146] [CMOMgen: Complex Multi-Ontology Alignment via Pattern-Guided In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21656)
*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，不限制目标本体或实体的数量。该方法在三个生物医学任务中表现出色，在类别选择上优于基线方法，F1分数最低达到63%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体来将数据完全上下文化到特定领域。简单的成对等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成，需要更复杂的多本体匹配方法。

Method: CMOMgen采用检索增强生成方法，选择相关类别来组成映射，并过滤匹配的参考映射作为示例来增强上下文学习。这是第一个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务的评估中，CMOMgen在类别选择上优于基线方法，在三个任务中的两个任务中F1分数超过所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。手动评估显示46%的非参考映射获得最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的映射，在复杂多本体匹配任务中表现出色，证明了其专用策略的有效性。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的专家标注视频广告数据集，专注于检测能源公司的公关框架，特别是绿色创新和环境信息的识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公司投入大量资金进行公关活动，但有时存在言行不一的情况，如石油天然气公司的"绿色洗白"现象。理解大规模框架及其变化有助于分析公关活动的目标和性质。

Method: 构建了一个从Facebook和YouTube获取的专家标注视频广告数据集，包含13种框架类型的标注，涵盖20个国家的50多家公司或倡导团体，专门用于评估视觉语言模型。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1能检测环境信息，F1分数达79%，但最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅获得46%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源领域战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时指出了视觉语言模型需要解决的挑战，如隐含框架、不同长度视频处理和文化背景理解。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态环境中自主智能体协调时，高层任务目标与低层规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。

Method: 引入以知识图谱为核心的框架，采用两层架构：将声明性事实编译为每个智能体的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，使任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 在墨西哥湾的自主水下航行器案例研究中，可视化展示了端到端流程，并定量证明不同的声明性策略能产生独特且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.
